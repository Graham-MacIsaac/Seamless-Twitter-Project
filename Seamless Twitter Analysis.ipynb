Come hear from the candidates - how will they address the challenges BART is facing? What do they see for the future of BART on a regional level? Co-hosted w/ @SFTRU https://t.co/ip7Nd2d25K https://t.co/OhvhNflfs1(8) All this make you mad? Head over to MTC - meeting now Demand streamlined fare policies, simplified biz rules,  a focus on the rider's experience. Demand that contracts be properly value engineered. Even demand a re-bid. But definitely demand real regional leadership.(7) SO what to do? Asking for a re-bid WILL drag out a long C2 process even longer. BUT: isn't it time we had higher expectations? What if we didn't just throw our hands up in the air, hope for better next time? Unless we hold MTC to account, next time will never be better.(6) By re-structuring the proposal, we could even ask for better integration, a focus on rider needs not MTC or transit agency needs, and a chance to streamline that ugly tangle of business logic and ludicrously outdated fare policy.(5) If we keep on the way we're going, we'll never know what we're losing out on in price or value or features. MTC shut the door on simpler, better system of fares &amp; rules and therefore on vendors who might have saved us all money and made C2 experience better for everyone.(4) But, honestly, the slippery ease with which Cubic came into $0.5B of public money without competition, has got us mad. That part of us that's fed up with bad regional leadership wants to demand that the sole bid be rejected and the project be re-structured.(3) There IS still time to recover some value from this bid. Streamlining biz rules &amp; fare policy before code gets pushed wd deliver a more cost-effective and reliable project, &amp; yield benefits in equity, ridership, environmental outcomes, customer experience.(2) When this advice was ignored, most vendors wisely dropped out. Any contractor that's left standing after that, is not a contractor you want. Lo and behold, MTC is about to award 0.5B sole bid from a defense contractor with a side business in transit.(1) So, about this Clipper 2.0 thing: it's pretty clear that @MTCBATA has fumbled the ball on a $0.5B contract. It was warned by vendors early on that not streamlining its 35k business rules and ludicrously complex fare policy was a recipe for disaster, yet chose to ignore.@graue @derivativeburke @graue we're on it. So many missed opportunities here. It's time we all stood up for better governance of regional transit: we agree w/ @SPUR_Urbanist that there's a fare policy problem, but there's also an expectations problem. Government contracting should work better, period.Are you interested in supporting the work we're doing to develop a seamless transportation system in the Bay Area?

And, the board REALLY appreciated having six constituents present and wanting to speak - County Connection doesn't get many commenters and they were welcomedAnd Board Chair Keith Haydon of Clayton talked about the importance of improving ease of use for transit users. Worth expessed concerns about ensuring that it's not a zero sum game - better regional connex should not be done at the expense of local service...Ramacier commented that \"it is my hope that we will be able to be supportive.\" Board Member Amy Worth, who is an MTC Commissioner and sits on the task force, talked about the value of seamless service to help bring back ridership to transit and serve constituents..GM Rick Ramacier talked about ongoing work at the regional Blue Ribbon Transit Recover Task Force to recommend how to integrate the system and the likely prospect of legislation that Asm Chiu said at the task force he is looking to bringAt today's County Connection board, six people who live in or have frequent trips to Central Contra Costa County spoke or wrote in about how helpful it would be to have more seamlessly integrated transit, complementary to the need for restored and improved local transit https://t.co/uTejtVhvvZSeeing clear commitment to additional future transit funding will give transit agencies the confidence to participate more fruitfully in discussions of fare integration and governance reforms.Saving transit will require a major new source of regional funds.

As we reset Phase II of BART to SV, let's think long and hard where we want BART to go beyond Diridon. https://t.co/H4831nwV6BFinally, we need more progressive ways to fund transit, not just sales taxes. Regional parking levies, equitable congestion pricing, income tax surcharges for transit, and other progressive revenue sources need to be enabled thru future legislation.The current Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force is the right venue for governance discussions. We ask elected officials in the 3 counties to support that process, and the legislation that will come out of it, to develop holistic governance solutions for seamless transit.A 1/8 cent sales tax with no ‚Äúreturn to source‚Äù requirements is the best way to keep the system running through covid-19, with a commitment to a process to fix Caltrain governance so that the rail line is managed, planned, and funded as one line of an integrated regional system.Caltrain‚Äôs flawed governance needs to be fixed - we need to stop thinking of it as a stand-alone system. It needs to be governed and funded as part of a regionally integrated rail and bus system for the Bay Area - accountable to a Bay Area Transit network manager.Funding for regional transit should be allocated predictably, not be subject to local jurisdictions withholding funds in any given year, holding riders hostage. The new conditions proposed are the opposite of what Bay Area transit needs now to adapt to this crisis. https://t.co/dkkHReXYj0@TransitGeekJoe @RebeccaForBART @SFBART @sfmta_muni Thank you for your support Joe!‚ú®hopeüöÇ https://t.co/UZrbJIy7xkGreat thread. @Caltrain must evolve into an affordable, high frequency line seamlessly integrated into a multi-modal system.

A ‚Äútemporary‚Äù shutdown means permanent layoffs, permanent shifts in how people get around, and a permanent loss of faith among the public and employers in the reliability of transit.We hope the @sfbos now realizes that failing to act in July to authorize this measure will be a huge setback for sustainable transit in the Bay - severing the most direct transit link btwn our 2 largest job centers, leaving thousands of riders behind &amp; preventing a green recoveryBut there is no time to blame anyone for what‚Äôs already happened. We need to quickly figure out how to move forward and save this ballot measure so we can avoid a Caltrain shutdown.Based on info we gathered in the last 24 hrs, it seems that the onerous process for advancing this measure to the ballot - which required approval by 7 boards - resulted in confusion among some BoS members, &amp; many staff &amp; advocates, about the need for a cmte referral yesterdayMany Bay Area residents are understandably confused and upset after the SF Board of Supervisors yesterday declined to advance a ballot measure that could have provided stable funding for Caltrain and helped to avoid a prolonged shutdown.Tune in now: https://t.co/OFzTFAN21rWe are deeply disappointed in today's decision by the Board.

(5) Balance regional and local interests; (6) Make sure this is linked to other broad policy policy objectives - climate, rail integrationDesmond from Sam Schwartz (consultant team) summarizes feedback from meetings: (1) Focus on outcomes - ridership, customer experience (2) Center customers (3) think boldly, and be courageous; don't lose the momentum of the moment...McMillan - observation that when the NM discussion began, people thought that we'd be creating a NM upon a 'recovered' transit system; however, we may need to shift our thinking toward NM as a framework overlaid on a permanently changed mobility landscape.Final item:  Guided discussion on priorities for the task force in evaluating NM options. https://t.co/zFxc9LtOeF6-7 members of the public make comments, mostly urging the advisory group to center the needs of riders - including both transit dependent riders and potential riders who might be attracted to transit. Also a request to use less jargon to make this more accessible to the public.Currier (Transform) - As we consider risk, let's make sure we consider the risk to riders.  She will do her best to try to center the voices of riders and people with disabilities, who are underrepresented on this task force.McMillan:  Public sector is not always allowed to experiment or 'fail'; this makes it more risk-averse (i.e. change-averse) - can the Business Case help evaluate this?McMillan - the outcome of this process must be better service to customers.  Big part of business case must be an 'infrastructure' able to work and deliver these outcomes - the 'bureaucracy' (institutions) that will do it must be identified. Include, staffing, resources, etc.Wunderman - this is a unique opportunity to put forth a bold vision - and possibly one of our last chances to put in place.Wunderman - there will never be enough money for transit.  For that reason if there are certain options for NM that require money, that shouldn't be an obstacle to advancing it - let's go out and find the money.Raad indicates that significant additional work has been done by the operators to further develop the \"network management options\", since the conclusion of the BRTF last fall.Management vs Manager options on the table https://t.co/BZPEdr8cVrTamim Raad of Access Planning introduces a the consultant team - the same one that served the Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force, bringing experience from across North America on governance.Dennis Mulligan of Golden Gate Transit has been elected as Chair, Alicia John-Baptiste of @SPUR_Urbanist as Vice-ChairStarting now: @MTCBATA's kickoff meeting for the Network Management Business Case Advisory Group:  https://t.co/oGGvOSVBbVüí° NEW on our blog: Kenji Anzai explores how different German regions developed different forms of transit network managers, or verkehrsverb√ºnde, and delves into lessons these regions can provide for the Bay Area. ‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/MF5zhSYn7CRider voices are needed at this 1st meeting to show advisory group members how important this issue is to the Bay Area's future - so please tune in &amp; speak up!\n\n&amp; sign up for our mailing list to make sure you get notified about future action opportunities: https://t.co/311IPwWrL2Over the next 9 months, this group and @MTCBATA  will determine how to reform Bay Area transit governance for the next generation.

Timed bus connections and free bus transfers would make ferries accessible to far more people and avoid the need for large parking lots at ferry terminals.@kerbyside @MTCBATA @mtcbata was arguably created to coordinate transit but its mandate was never very well defined, and it lacks authority. Transit agencies have no direct accountability to MTC so they do what they want. So MTC mostly acts as a convener.@Lesdoggg @Seamless_Care .@Lesdoggg we can only assume you are irate about the ridiculously inconvenient transfer between @sfbart and @sfmta_muni at Embarcadero and Civic Center. We feel you! Let‚Äôs break down those metal bars and integrate our transit fares.@mcplanner @MTCBATA To be clear, @MTCBATA actually was trying to advance fare integration. Those who voted against it were the Transit Agency GMs, who sit on the @BayAreaClipper Exec Board, which is operated out of @MTCBATA but has a different board. Sound confusing and unnecessarily complex? It is.Business-as-usual with Bay Area transit: @SFBART, @VTA, @caltrain and other general managers vote to delay action on integrating transit fares. https://t.co/HPIaMyN18kLet‚Äôs make sure the @SFBART Board selects a new GM who puts riders first and champions seamless transit. Our future depends on it.  https://t.co/SJfkRH94Sq. @StreetsblogSF @icgee@calisurf @BayAreaClipper @SPUR_Urbanist @bayrailalliance Each GM had a different suggestion as to ‚Äúwho else‚Äù needed to be consulted (e.g. small operators, staff, board members), on a topic that has been widely discussed since January, and which Clipper customers have asked for repeatedly in surveys. Why can‚Äôt leaders just lead?@davehod @thecliffbar @CalOccupier @Scott_Wiener @andrewchen We‚Äôre fighting hard for comprehensive solutions to improve Bay Area transit &amp; transportation, which requires addressing poor governance &amp; lack or regional leadership. $ alone won‚Äôt be enough; we must reform our institutions and so we get better mobility for our public dollars.The meeting perfectly demonstrated how lack of leadership or clear responsibility for regional transit leads us to repeatedly kick the can down the road to avoid taking any meaningful steps to integrate Bay Area transit or make it more affordable.All transit agency GMs took turns claiming ‚Äúnot enough consultation‚Äù had taken place. They don‚Äôt trust @MTCBATA to develop a scope of work for $600k.Very disappointing @BayAreaClipper Executive Board meeting today.  Transit Agency GMs vote to postpone approve funds for a business case study of fare integration until October, despite public comment in support from @seamlessbayarea, @SPUR_Urbanist, and @bayrailalliance.We are excited to be working with groups across the Bay Area to make sure new funding for transportation occurs alongside critical governance reforms.We agree major new transit funding is needed and support the concept of a major ballot measure. However to make good use of new funding, we must address our  governance of transportation, tie our investments to clear mobility goals and set up effective institutions..@mercnews + @EastBayTimes nailed it: ‚ÄúThe last thing we need is yet another ballot measure with a grab bag of projects. What‚Äôs needed is a holistic approach that integrates the Bay Area‚Äôs 26 bus, train + ferry agencies + 9 congestion management agencies.‚Äù https://t.co/kCE3i935MZ@tails_dorian Yes, that is the fundamental problem. We have never said that the solution is a single operator. Governance reform is needed to establish a central authority to set standards, do network planning, and coordinate multiple operators.  More info here:  https://t.co/BuY6Frr1FR‚ÄúWith so many railroads and operating agencies, who would ultimately run the new services? The hope is to make that transparent to the user.‚Äù  Hope?  We can‚Äôt pin our transit future on hopes, we need serious proposals for governance reform to create a seamless system! https://t.co/2aO9oCDRhx@SPUR_Urbanist @BayAreaCouncil @SVLeadershipGrp Agreed - and let‚Äôs make sure we create the right institutions to enable success!  More money on its own won‚Äôt solve our transit woes - we need governance reform to create a seamless, customer-focused system.@calisurf @SPUR_Urbanist It‚Äôs the tragedy of the commons and lack of leadership. Everyone acknowledges better regional governance is needed, yet without a compelling leader, we continue on the way we always have. We need strong, articulate champions of regionalism to overcome apathy and inertia.60 minutes to get between any two rail stations in the Bay Area?  Yes please! We‚Äôre excited about @SPUR_Urbanist‚Äôs vision for seamless megaregional rail. Check out our latest blog post: https://t.co/jpGSOVsjaH@hoverbird Transit Agencies do badly in UI and CX because they lack executive leadership in these areas. We recently wrote a blog post on this:  https://t.co/Q2qTzZyFBsNone of the Bay Area‚Äôs transit 27 agencies have a ‚ÄúChief Customer Officer‚Äù or departments dedicated to improving the customer experience of using transit.

We'd love to get your feedback about zones in our quick survey about the map (if you have a minute): https://t.co/izErwnWI0P@Eeeszy Our vision accounts for this - that's why we propose that the cost for the first *two* zones is the same local base fare. That way any short trip of 7 miles or less will be no more than $2.20, even if you cross a zone boundary. https://t.co/SBITffwtM8Fired up about our Integrated Fare Vision Map and the possibility of a truly integrated fare system in the Bay Area? Your support can help make integrated fares a reality.\n\nMake a contribution today: https://t.co/yhTRAyrLhQ https://t.co/FXMAoR4TFl@BayBetter An important point. In order to make integrated fares reality, the Bay Area would need to appoint a regional authority to set fare policy &amp; collect/distribute fare revenue across the 9 counties.\n\nFill out our quick map survey if you have a minute!  https://t.co/izErwnWI0P@AnneSpevack Thanks for your feedback, Anne!

We'd love for you to fill out our quick Vision Map survey, if you have a few minutes: https://t.co/izErwnWI0P@bryanculbertson Yes, ferries are part of this vision. Ferry fares would be equal to bus/train fare between the same start + end. Ferries should be accessible to all, not just high income folks.

It's free and open to all! https://t.co/2RLN1bwcWnWe hope our new map can accelerate a regional conversation about integrated fares in the Bay Area by making it easier to visualize how a comprehensive system of fares could work. \n\nRead all the details on our blog: https://t.co/PixVz2pr0Y https://t.co/b8tV4UpOVATransitioning to fully integrated fares would also require establishing a central regional authority with the ability to set fare policy, &amp; collect and distribute fare revenue to transit operators across the 9-county region.\n\nMore details about that here: https://t.co/P94GGBfgVVOur sketch-level financial analysis of the Integrated Fare Vision shows that regional fare revenue levels would remain similar to the pre-COVID status quo, but that the transit system would need add'l revenue to cover the additional discounts proposed for low income riders.Fare integration would be a highly beneficial long-term investment for the region. Earlier this year, MTC found that integrated fares were one of the most cost-effective projects we could invest in, attracting more people to transit &amp; reducing costs for low income people.Our Integrated Fare Vision resembles zone-based fare systems used in other regions‚Äîsuch as Zurich, Copenhagen, and greater Frankfurt‚Äî that have resulted in growing and widespread transit use in both urban and suburban areas. https://t.co/EK1bKinVeAOur Integrated Fare Vision would be a departure from the Bay Area‚Äôs current fragmented fare policies, in which riders pay additional fares &amp; are subject to different rules each time they transfer, which can make both local &amp; regional trips expensive and confusing ü§îDaily, weekly, and monthly fare caps would also give riders free additional trips once they take transit at least 2.5 times per day, 9 times a week, or 36 times per month ‚Äî eliminating the need for riders to decide before they travel whether to buy a high frequency pass. https://t.co/8NgwpPEfXdUnder our Integrated Fare Vision proposal, riders would be charged the same amount *no matter what mode of transit they use or how many times they transfer*, providing more predictability for riders while encouraging people to use the fastest route available. https://t.co/CynNkh04GPThe map divides the Bay Area into a series of 7-mile wide zones, each about the size of San Francisco. Fares are easy to calculate; riders simply count the minimum number of zones required to go between two points on the map, then look up the corresponding fare in the table. https://t.co/BYL0q8in8hToday, Seamless Bay Area is unveiling a map of our Integrated Transit Fare Vision ‚Äî a fully unified system of transit fares that would enable riders to travel seamlessly across the nine-county Bay Area with a single transit fare and free transfers üó∫Ô∏è https://t.co/P94GGBfgVV https://t.co/J1Yh89BzE4Read more on our blog: https://t.co/agBBiq41nf\n\nAnd thank you to our forum co-hosts @SFTRU, @ylinstitute, @alevin &amp; Friends of Caltrain, @SVYouthClimateA, @TransitRidersEB , and United Seniors of Oakland and Alameda County!Two riders currently living in one-car households reported that they were now considering buying a second car due to challenges riding transit in the Bay Area during the pandemic.One Sonoma County resident and transit rider reported that she had been forced to turn down a swing shift job because local buses are now only operating until 6:00 p.m., making it impossible for her to travel there and back.Riders reported ‚Äúlarge gaps‚Äù between buses on lines where service used to be more frequent, longer commutes, and challenges getting to work and to the airport.Takeaways from our Bay Area Transit Rider Forum on Oct. 15, focused on service changes and connectivity:\n\nAmong riders who have used transit regularly since March, many have experienced significant changes in their travel experience due to service cuts. https://t.co/agBBiq41nf‚òéÔ∏è On Oct. 28, we're joining @SPUR_Urbanist &amp; Asm. @DavidChiu for a special phone bank supporting #MeasureRR! \n\nWe'd love to see you there - tools &amp; training will be provided: https://t.co/ukfiBdkcVw\n\nCan't make it?

Do you hope for the friendliest wayfinding? Dial in to AC Transit tonight if you use Salesforce terminal https://t.co/slJ1mHe28uBut, these benefits weren't considered in the fare study recs.  Now, there's a risk that fully integrated fares may be taken off the table, because wayfinding wasn't considered, because institutional change would be needed, &amp; because  higher benefits come with higher costs...The study concludes that streamlined wayfinding would have hundreds of millions of dollars of additional economic benefits... https://t.co/rQ8Fwz586OThis is because, when fare policy is consistent across services, the operating agency of any given bus, train, or ferry is no longer essential information that a rider needs to understand or remember... https://t.co/82Yu8vhxGFTonight, AC Transit board is getting an update on Salesforce Transbay wayfinding.

Together, unified Bay Area transit wayfinding and fares can signifcantly increase transit ridership and access. \nNew on our blog:\nhttps://t.co/mDvbC9OZvtFare and wayfinding integration are extremely popular with stratospheric poll results, so a proposal for streamlined fares and signage would help pass a ballot measure https://t.co/YNJFaPED8gThe study shows that fare integration would have costs, and deeper levels of integration cost more, but would be a cost-effective way to gain ridership.  MTC is considering convening a process for transit funding (for 2024+), so that will be an opportunity to fund integration...@_Nataliea schedule integration is also needed but is separate and not covered in the fare integration study. So if schedules are integrated the results will be better.If you would like to weigh in on Bay Area fare integration, the Fare Integration Task Force is getting an update today at 12:30pm. The Zoom link is https://t.co/ho7uk5iNJv Suggestions for crafting your own comments https://t.co/psvACpzAV5And, full fare integration would be able to unlock hundreds of additional millions in benefits by streamlining wayfinding/signage https://t.co/GlpGaJ1UNXThe study also shows that fare integration is an effecitve way to reduce driving. Standardizing regional fares or fully integrating fares would reduce driving 4x as much as Caltrain electrification, which is famed for being able to replace the need for 5 freeway lanes https://t.co/LTjmEJNy2NAnd the study shows that fare integration is a very cost-effective way to grow ridership - much more cost-effective than many other transit investments.... https://t.co/SOGXA9rOZlFree transfers would generate over 25,000 new trips, as much or more ridership as flagship bus likes such as the AC Transit 51 lines.  Standardized regional fares and/or full integration would generate as much or more ridership than Caltrain pre-Covid https://t.co/cU2HzRwlFLNew regional fare integration study indicates that fare integration would likely result in notable transit ridership increases.  \nhttps://t.co/XohYTJg5ynüì£ Happening in 3 days: our exclusive #TransitMonth conversation w/ @christofspieler about how transit can be better connected &amp; more accessible. üôå\n\nBonus: we‚Äôll be offering special book deals!

Is that complicated? Yes, it is..@icgee: Putting this system into place would require reforms to our current system, including establishing a central regional authority that would administer fares and policies\"Under our proposal, any trip within 1 or 2 zones is a local fare price, so short trips aren't penalized.\" @icgeeSeamless policy director @icgee: The Bay Area's existing fare system has problems with complexity, equity, and inefficiency - and isn't aligned with broader mobility goals\"A good fare system supports equity. It should have structures built in to have different prices for different riders. And it should be easy to understand.\" - @christofspielerUrban planning expert @christofspieler today on our fare map webinar: \"A good fare system is mode neutral, and spans multiple agencies.

Equitable accessibility to local + regional destinations should be a lens for making service decisions.\n4. To realize the accessibility benefits of an optimized network, reduce disincentives to transfers.\n5. Long-term funding sources need to do better than pre-COVID.2/4. Key conclusions from our high-level analysis:\n1. The next 2yrs are critical; severe congestion + traffic lie ahead without a strong return to transit.\n2. Overall accessibility can be expanded ‚Äî to local and regional destinations ‚Äî while keeping total service hours the sameHow should transit service adapt to COVID while maintaining connectivity + equitable access for transit dependent people?

The passage of Measure RR is an important step in the right direction.This week, these collective efforts paid off, with Bay Area residents voting resoundingly to fund Caltrain service and enable Caltrain to continue to serve the workers and communities who rely on it.This summer, this diverse coalition came together to keep Caltrain's funding measure headed to the ballot üòÖ And over the past three months, Measure RR supporters made 15,000+ calls to voters, sent 135,000 text messages, &amp; dropped tens of thousands of fliers across the Bay Area.This outcome would not have been possible without the commitment, vision, and leadership of Bay Area community leaders, advocates, and volunteers. üëè https://t.co/GU8ZONZMBJWe‚Äôre thrilled that Bay Area voters stood together to decisively pass #MeasureRR and rescue Caltrain.

We need to have a common vision for a regional measure to pass.Gloria Ohland of @MoveLATransit critical question for Bay Area:  Who's going to be your Champion?  LA had the Mayor of LA, and an Excellent Transit Agency (@metrolosangeles); the Bay Area's fragmentation presents a challenge to having a clear champion.@TransForm_Alert @Urban_Habitat @siliconvalleycf Seattle Deputy Mayor Shefali Ranganathan shares that critical to Seattle's success was having a bold vision that communicated the promise of connectivity, including the number of jobs and housing accessible within 30, 60 minutes because of new transpo improvements.We‚Äôre at important discussion going on today on how to build a successful transportation measure in 2020 hosted by @TransForm_Alert @Urban_Habitat and @siliconvalleycf, with special guests from Seattle and LA sharing lessons learned from successful ballot measures in 2016. https://t.co/wEo7eyrOq5@suldrew @FitzTheReporter @ladyfleur @IDoTheThinking @ArmandDoma @graue We support common dog policies across all 27 transit operatorsNominations for the Seamless Bay Area Award are open!

We need state+regional institutions whose mandate is to move *people*, not just cars https://t.co/8N4ciH4JWs@theGreaterMarin @transitmap @kyrilnegoda @City_ID @MTCBATA More of what's in store: https://t.co/rnRINmGv5v@sheeter @theGreaterMarin @transitmap @MTCBATA @City_ID @SPUR_Urbanist Here's an MTC Staff Report from January which has an earlier version of the map and more info Regional Transit Mapping project:  https://t.co/LFrIaWatPP https://t.co/0dIlkG4jPH@theGreaterMarin @transitmap @MTCBATA @City_ID @SPUR_Urbanist But, pretty maps and wayfinding do not fix an illogical underlying transit network. To get the most out of better maps, we need more coordinated, connected service, otherwise there's a false promise of connectivity. This requires reforms to #governance (which we're working on!)@theGreaterMarin @transitmap @MTCBATA @City_ID @SPUR_Urbanist From what we have seen, there will be some big improvements to some to the Bay Area's standard transit maps coming soon, and @MTCBATA certainly deserves credit for moving that forward.@theGreaterMarin @transitmap @MTCBATA This is the product of @MTCBATA's regional transit mapping effort over the past 2 years, done alongside an update to regional wayfinding conventions. @City_ID was the design firm. @SPUR_Urbanist's advocacy around wayfinding was critical to making this happen.Action Alert: Show your support for environmentally-friendly transportation investments in Contra Costa County, before the @CCTA meeting tomorrow.

They define ‚Äúmass rapid transit‚Äù as just subway or elevated rail and dismiss any surface transit or buses. Would have loved to have seen a more nuanced definition of rapid transit based on speed. https://t.co/YB3qVwfglkOwen cites a powerful example: 50% of the increase in access to jobs and destinations brought about by @MetroTransitMN's recently opened Green Line was due to redesigning bus network to integrate seamlessly with the new LRT when it opened.Relevant follow up to the @SPUR_Urbanist 7/23 panel, Modeling Transformational Transit Projects w/ @AECOMTransport @interline_io @MTCBATA: Fascinating podcast discusses the potential for accessibility metrics to used as part of regional transportation planning, like @PlanBayArea https://t.co/qm2TzHZ3RXLooking for something fun to do this Sunday?

We're excited to continue partnering w/ @SPUR_Urbanist to build a better future for the region AND the transit riders of the Bay Area![7/x] @SPUR_Urbanist  proposes 4 strategies:\n1. Streamline &amp; integrate fares\n2. Manage fare policy &amp; fare payment to support #seamlesstransit\n3. Make fare payment work for everyone\n4. Integrate transit fare payment w/ payment for other transportation costs‚Äù[7/x] So how do we fix this fare policy mess?! By streamlining &amp; integrating transit fares across the region.  \n\ni.e. \"transit operators working together to align their fare policies &amp; collectively organize their fare structures\"[6/x]‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to approach fare policy strategically as a region\" to ensure:\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs easy for transit riders to understand/calculate the price of a ride\n‚Ä¢ Crossing city boundaries &amp; switching between transit systems is simple/hassle-free\n‚Ä¢ Transit is affordable[5/x] \"There are 2 pressing reasons why it can‚Äôt wait any longer:\"\n1. @MTCBATA is developing Clipper 2.0\n2. Access to the Bay Area‚Äôs transit network is uneven -- \"solving the fare policy problem is key to addressing  widening inequalities and the suburbanization of poverty\"[4/x] It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Transit in the Bay Area will work best when all the pieces fit together[3/x] 5 problems with our fragmented transit fare policies:\n\"1. limit the use of transit\n2.  penalize riders who take multi-operator trips\n3.  price some people out of transit\n4. don‚Äôt support plans for integrated stations and services\n5. limit the usability/appeal of Clipper\"[2/x] Context: ‚ÄúThere are more than 2 dozen public transit operators in the region, and each sets its own fare policy. This has led to a hodgepodge of different fare structures, passes and prices that ultimately holds the Bay Area back from realizing the promise of transit\"[1/x] Excellent white paper from @SPUR_Urbanist re:the Bay Area transit fare policy mess. It‚Äôs a regional issue &amp; a solution is long overdue. \n\nWe'll continue working to solve this, because a more equitable, sustainable, &amp; seamless system depends on it\n\nhttps://t.co/9sUoz0tMuM@sfcta Seamless integration of transit across SF and the Bay Area - integrated fares, customer experience, maps, route &amp; schedule planning, timed connections.@rahulkartgupta @YIMBYNeoliberal @MTCBATA Most Bay Area transit isn‚Äôt actually managed directly by counties - it‚Äôs managed by some counties, but also by cities, special districts, and joint powers authorities, some of which span several counties.A more equitable Bay Area requires reforming our transit in 2 key ways:  We must BOTH integrate our fragmented system and run it as one seamless, affordable network AND greatly increase service to provide reliable, efficient mobility in all parts of the region.In the Bay Area, low income people with the highest transpo costs are commuting the furthest, suffering most from lack a regionally connected transit system. Lack of integrated routes, fares and schedules makes transit costly and inconvenient, forcing many to own cars and drive.Public transit is one of the best possible investments we can make in reducing inequality and poverty.  Imagine if poor Americans had 22.5% more income to spend on other things.Lack of quality public transit hurts poor people most, forcing many into expensive car ownership.\n\nUS: The poorest 20% spend 29% of income on transportation - mostly vehicle ownership costs because transit is so poor.\n\nEurope: The poorest 20% spend just 7.5% on transportation. https://t.co/wpgJqJ3UQw‚ÄúThe metro area lacks a shared aspiration and commitment to making its collective public transit network the best and most convenient option for a greater share of trips, nor does it have the mechanisms in place to deliver such a vision.‚Äù DC, we feel your pain.The movement for seamless transit is growing nationwide.  The DC Area struggles with many of the same issues we do: ‚ÄúNo one entity is accountable for delivering a unified, seamless consumer-oriented regional transit network.‚Äù @ggwash https://t.co/l2oPGX0n1t@BetterConnecti1 East Palo Alto to Milpitas?  4 transfers, 17 miles, approximately 1:40-2hrs minimum.You asked, we delivered! @seamlessbayarea t-shirts are in and lookin' awesome.

We‚Äôll hold you accountable too.@SFTRU This is consistent with what we heard from residents of Bayview in SF a few weeks ago when we asked them what would get them riding transit more. Greater frequency, reliability and better integration between systems was more important than cheaper fares.  https://t.co/E7RtuDagEbWe strongly support the regional means-based fares pilot program!  It‚Äôs a first step that can lead to greater integration and equity in our transit system. https://t.co/X3kpjlbDE3@SundayStreets Yesterday @VivaCalleSJ we asked dozens of people what would get them to ride transit more in the Bay Area.

Voluntary collaboration is unlikely to be enough - we need to think of where we have leverage.((in the 1 minute provided for public comment, Seamless commented on the importance of creating a unified regional operator in improving project delivery))public comment happening now3 key questions:  (1) Should MTC set up a standard risk oversight process for megaprojects? (2) Should MTC implement a stage gate process?  (3) Should MTC condition funding on policy compliance?  If so what policies rise to the top? https://t.co/j35q1dBPF9Final discussion period:  What's MTC's role?  Pedroza:  Key question is how to implementing partners see MTC's role as additive, and not a hostile takeover?Now for the Megaproject Advancement Program. Kenneth Folan summarizes feedback from Commissioners - when costs change, cost-benefit should be reassessed. And there's a highlight on risk management strategies...Abe-Koga - perhaps not as oversight but as a resource to vet best practices, technologies. I shy away from the word oversight, I don't want to add more layers of bureaucracy.They could get paid for from the projects, defining cost, scope with a sense of objectivity ((I like the metaphor of a circuit rider rather than a mercenary))Liccardo, since we have FTA, additional oversight is not needed.  Refers to Josefowitz comments about experience and optimism bias.  MTC could staff a pool of project management professionals with experience with big projects.Chavez - adding extra layers adds complexity. Could instead we have more best practices to draw on from a regional level, for example with grade separations.  We should be a regional catalyst that creates opportunities for things we do in our communities....Commissioner Chavez - what is an example? McMillan's answer includes looking at the landscape and seeing what foundational capabilities might be missing ((such as integrated regional rail?))but even for the projects in the works, there is a role to play for oversight processes beyond what's provided by FTA - stage gate processes, independent peer reviews.and asks what role to play with regard to projects that are already in progress, in a way that does not add cost and delay...Vice Chair Josefowitz envisions a greater role for future projects starting with a connected network plan to ensure projects that build together in a good sequence...Spering calls on consultant to focus on what is best for the customer, not what existing constraints are.  We get too hung up on what works for operators - we must get beyond this.  Let's know what legislative changes are needed.Now Kate White of @ArupGroup facilitates a discussion among the Commission on what should MTC's role be?Back to Dawson who presents the timeline of the Rail Partnerships study.  Alternative assessment findings will feed into Network Management business case study.  ((Will a merged regional operator become one of the logical opportunities for a network manager?)) https://t.co/upJwKnM2RwCommon features - Layering of different organizations; Constant evolution over time.Success factors:  Developing necessary resources &amp; expertises; develop more systematic approach to innovation - Crossrail in particular led to a number of ongoing programs to share best practices more broadly within the sector.Once projects are complete from these special purpose entities, assets are transferred back to TfL or Network Rail.Gold also notes that London has also had a lot of evolution over time (like Toronto); layering in London:  TfL sets objectives for projects;  Network Rail operates many services and delivers many major projects;  HS2 and Crossrail are special purpose delivery vehicles. https://t.co/qHET72iTmfRaquel gold describes the 'layering' of various entities in greater Toronto - a provincial project delivery advisory entity, Infrastructure Ontario - a region-wide combined operator and project owner, Metrolinx (which includes GO Transit); and a local operator, TTC. https://t.co/jPGTtpwsyJRaquel Gold of consultant team takes over to introduce reference models for the bay area - greater Toronto, and greater London. https://t.co/57l9zxc2d8Lines of inquiry for this study:  Understanding suitability of existing structures in delivering on our many ambitions. https://t.co/PHHHPm627RAlaistair Dawson of @Steer_Group takes over; caveats that this study is in 'exploratory' mode, and will stop short of making recommendations. https://t.co/wNcthSSJRbNow for the long awaited study - McMillan describes that the $400k planning grant MTC received to explore potential different governance and delivery structures to achieve a more effective and seamless rail network.  Steer was selected as consultant.MTC has also more direct project delivery role as a builder - for Bay Bridge, Express Lanes, Electronic Tolling infrastructure.  Not so much on transit today though.McMillan:  MTC's current role in megaprojects is both as  a funder and an investor.  Investor refers to $$ that is fully within MTC's authority, i.e. RM 1, 2, or 3 funds.  This implies a bigger role for MTC's involvement.(public comment will be at the very end of the workshop, probably this afternoon sometime. But this is an important presentation to watch. We'll attempt to summarize key points here)Happening now: \nMTC's role in getting major projects delivered, with Executive Director Therese McMillan and the consultants from Steer giving the first preview of the long awaited Regional Rail Partnerships Governance &amp; Delivery study.\n\nhttps://t.co/LITAzCJ0SkLastly, in your public comment, feel free to use any of the talking points in the letter we submitted with @JointVentureSVN: https://t.co/1t8teFnXZq\nAsk @MTCBATA to do a detailed study on the costs &amp; benefits of a BART-Caltrain merger as a next step to the Regional Rail study.For more reasons why we think a unified rail operator - bringing together @SFBART and @Caltrain under one unified board - check out our blog post:  https://t.co/BpgAeCnXFfHere's the full agenda:\nhttps://t.co/7o1p85NCsm\n\nAnd here's the zoom link to make a comment.\nhttps://t.co/LITAzCJ0SkToday @MTCBATA is having a workshop on how to improve megaproject delivery. We must take immediate steps to create a unified Bay Area rail operator to create the expertise &amp; governance that can deliver our biggest projects. Speak up during Item #3 ~10:30-11:30am if you agree https://t.co/llGBumCbTZMotion to enable 2 hour free transfers and assess whether there is a Title VI problem (equity problem). If no problem, move ahead.  If there's a potential problem, bring it back to the board.Board member Peeples asks what % of people are using the mobile app vs. Clipper. Answer - about 1% are using the app...Board member Young is asking why free transfers is needed when there is a day pass with 3 trips per day. Director Shaw says that sometimes she takes the bus one way and takes BART in the other direction...Staff is saying that the mobile app already allows free transfers within 90 minutes because when you enable a ticket it's good for 90 minutes automatically - so they could change that to 2 hours without having to wait for Clipper...the Clipper project is saying that this feature won't be available until Clipper 2.0 in 2023 (which is reasonable), but that intra-agency transfers won't be available until even later than that (which is not reasonable)The AC Transit item on free bus to bus transfers is up now - this is the Zoom link to dial in and make public comment https://t.co/4Q0zh5MHz8 https://t.co/IkmsnKBgpGThe board changed the order of the meeting. They skipped forward to 7D and 7E, and will rewind afterward to 7A, 7B, and 7C (which is the free transfers item) https://t.co/mQvluUTUt0We‚Äôre here for this!

Mulligan closes the meeting - June 6th is next meeting!Tumlin:  \"Representativeness\" is an important concept - both of riders and of the population.  Muni has half the transit riders, SF is 75% of the origins/destinations in the region. How do we balance the need for geographic equity vs. set of needs for urban operators?McMillan:  This is a good summary of the essential elements. It's important to also recognize that these are stretch goals - where we should be headed - and it's OK that that's not where we are yet.Final part of the discussion:  Consultant team wants reactions on draft principles for entity design. https://t.co/YCR9vmDVoyFor example, blind passengers want to see standards for auditory queues across transit - on both regional and local service.Levin - Agrees with John-Baptiste that it's difficult to distinguish so distinctly between regional and local accountabilities when riders are reliant on all parts of the system to make a journey.Vice Chair John-Baptiste - What is our highest level goal with this?  Answer:  Transit must be the top choice for people, the easiest thing for people to choose.  This is necessary to then answer the question, \"what is regional vs. local\" - in reality it's hard to separate the 2.Currier - Key goal of RNM should to create the feeling of one unified system for riders.  RNM should take responsibility for equity regionally - serving concentrations of low income riders is not solely a local responsibility but a regional responsibility.Bouchard - Caltrain's challenge is that it's clearly a regional service but with impacts in a very local way - how is this handled? Notes the importance of highlighting what is the intersection between the parallel Regional Rail Partnership's study underway.Wunderman - disagrees with a slide in the packet that suggests that fares are a local responsibility - this seems out of step with MTC business case - asks for clarification. Especially with a new source of funding, fares can become a regional accountability - and should be.McMillan - key question is what is 'regionally significant' is very important - and can change over time based on circumstance. For example, a major local project might be considered local; but the moment it applies for regional money due to cost overruns, it becomes regional.Desmond (from consultant team) noted that another ad hoc committee emerging consensus was both \"do no harm\" -- but also don't use that as an excuse for not changing.Raad: Remarkable degree of alignment from ad hoc committee members on right division of accountabilites between RNM and local operators on infrastructure development, design, and delivery.  Key Q is what constitutes a 'major' project requiring regional accountability? https://t.co/7Lbd9OxLdkNow a discussion of accountabilities and authorities of a network manager....Familiar graphic, reprised from Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force - highighting which accountabilities (orange/red colors) require more direct authority from a centralized entity. https://t.co/HRmV7tJMOSRaad notes that accountabilities do not always match authorities - and this creates problems.  Creating a match is a key goal of governance reform.Authority = what powers does an entity hold to enable an accountable entity to carry out its assigned duties/obligations.Accountability = what entity is accountable for certain outcomes (i.e. integrated fares).Next Up: Discussion of what accountabilities and authorities of what a regional network manager (RNM) should be.Task force members compliment consultants on graphics and how these can be tools in helping us evaluate network management structures later on in the process.Raad: Fragmented landscape has been somewhat effective at meeting some local needs for funding, but not sufficient for regional needs.Another amazing slide summarizing complex funding sources, i.e. the root of the challenge. https://t.co/TJTTHIAnTRRaad:  Much transit agency ridership is local, but given how many regional trips are happening in cars, question is whether some amount of potential transit ridership is being 'left on the table'? https://t.co/1DZjzBgR3TTamim Raad of Access planning (consultant team) is sharing some amazing visualizations of the Bay Area's complex transit agency landscape https://t.co/KtryzTl537Network Management Business Case Advisory Committee happening now!

People are moving to the Central Valley, we should be focusing on travel to Tracy for affordable housing...Gonot - we want to work in coordination with MTC but transit agencies are so different, our funding sources are diverse. We could maybe accomplish it in 10 years.There are a lot of people from outside the county who work here and we want to make that easier.  We should say \"both and\" - we want it to work, and we want to set our conditions...We've got lots of reasons to gripe, and we're perceived as having a reputation for griping....Liccardo - I am afraid about the reputation we are getting for not being good regional collaborators...Lawson - our third fear is taking funding away from local operations. An example \"come up with a common format for real-time data\" - but the standard could change, and then we would need to change, and that would take money away from service....Mayor Liccardo.  I want to be clear about what are our fears - the loss of STA funding with noncompliance, the lack of representation on MTC. What else do we fear?...Lawson response to \"why are we looking only at one option.\" Sen Becker has recently introduced a bill SB917, with things we support - fares, wayfinding, tranfers. But it will be done by MTC, and if not agencies will be ineligible for STA funds ((this is a power MTC already has))Abe-Koga - the question is where the money would come from ((seamless transit polls at ~90% and is important to get future funding from voters))...We do want to serve our riders as seamlessly as possible... we've been hearing about input from riders, this  is important ((and how can riders give feedback when they use VTA and BART?))Abe-Koga - we're trying to do a one size fits all approach. Earlier on I had thought that consolidation might make sense, but it's not as easy as it might seem....The goal should be to respect the fact that there are 27 agencies with separate fiduciary responsibilities to taxpayers ((but what about when the taxpayers want service that is seamless across agencies?))What motivated this? Agencies working together to respond to Covid, being aware that there are 27 agencies with 27 boards and different sources of funding...We thought that the agencies putting service on the streets and should be the ones working together to get it done...Abe-Koga - what brought the GMs to bring this forward now, and what induced the GMs to come up with this \"preferred alternative\"Gonot - the first funding comes from federal relief money, and this is new money. We don't want to take money away from local trips to fund regional service ((this has not been proposed anywhere)).And Hendricks wants to know more about the roles and responsibilities sooner rather than later...Hendricks - what is the definition of success? How do we know it did a good thing. Is anyone looking at that? Haywood - it's early in the process. Different counties might have different goals....Hendricks - we are already aligning VTA service hours to connect to BART.  I'm looking for more clarity on what the practical change it would mean to us...It might affect signage and fares, where our board would no longer have the authority to set our own fares....Director Hendricks - can you explain what the change would be for VTA.  Haywood.  If the network manager required a transfer, we might have to run the service to make the transfer, instead of putting the service where we think it belongs...Chavez - I believe the goal is to do a better job of serving the public - in a self-help county...It feels to me like the direction MTC is going would be a greater barrier to us as a South Bay Region.Chavez - Santa Clara County is 25% of population but we've had a difficult time getting money to our county...Ramacier says that the operator option is similar to Clipper Executive Board with a broader range of operation....Gonot asks to for comparison with Clipper Executive Board.  Ramacier says this is similar, but CEB is focused on fare payment.Staff characterizes the alternative which would be a new body that could impose requirements on the transit agencies.Director Chavez - \"I have not felt that there are alternatives\" ((right they haven't been put forward yet))Staff - we will bring back the other alternatives also.  Peralez - we are moving in the right direction, but we should look at alternatives taking into account models around the countryCM Peralez asks for the board to see all of the options rather than to comment on one alternative, which staff had framed as a \"preferred alternative\"CM Peralez supports better transit coordination for riders even if this means agencies giving up some local control...VTA staff notes that most commute trips in Santa Clara County are intra-county, so transfers are less important in Santa Clara CountyThe model involves and advisory board where stakeholders advice a body composed of transit agency staff.    The model where stakeholders advice staff is the least powerful type of guidance.The proposal allows existing boards to retain their authorities, and changes will need to continue to go to 27 boards and MTC to make new policy refinementsVTA board is getting an update on the Bay Area's Transportation Network Management study.  But they are showing only one option, which is the option closest to the status quo....We have an infrastructure crisis in the Bay Area.

This is a no-brainer.  I hope we implement tier 3 (standardizing regional fares) as soon as possible - BART, Caltrain, regional bus, ferry....Saltzman - this strongly supports our TOD goals.   With longterm changes in office commuting, fare integration will help support a greater diversity of trips and riders.  Saltzman wants the board to take a resolution when appropriate...Saltzman - we had an attempt to do BART-AC Transit tranfers and learned that this is something that 2 agencies can't do alone....Director Saltzman - it is exciting to see recommendations we can use, some very soon and some later. I am supportive of all the recommendations. Free/reduced transfers would be huge....Raburn suports first 2 measures as a first step toward the big prize which is full fare integration, options 3 and 4....Raburn elevates comments about Capitol Corridor, ACE, etc.  Staff - lessons could potentially be drawn for a broader geography ((international case studies suggest that transit coordination systems get started and then grow in geography and functional scope))...staff: they will further analyze passes with information from the pilot...Raburn asks about fare capping and is puzzled why it's not yet a recommendation ((we think the analysis done for the study is incomplete))...BART board discusses fare integration.

This would be a good time to force the question: Does it really make sense to have such a disjointed network?\"\n\nNo.\n\nhttps://t.co/2S9YZg6w5eTomorrow, Tuesday 7/23, 12:30 PM at @SPUR_Urbanist San Jose.

Co-hosted w/ @SFTRU https://t.co/ip7Nd2d25K https://t.co/OhvhNflfs1(8) All this make you mad? Head over to MTC - meeting now Demand streamlined fare policies, simplified biz rules,  a focus on the rider\\'s experience. Demand that contracts be properly value engineered. Even demand a re-bid. But definitely demand real regional leadership.(7) SO what to do? Asking for a re-bid WILL drag out a long C2 process even longer. BUT: isn\\'t it time we had higher expectations? What if we didn\\'t just throw our hands up in the air, hope for better next time? Unless we hold MTC to account, next time will never be better.(6) By re-structuring the proposal, we could even ask for better integration, a focus on rider needs not MTC or transit agency needs, and a chance to streamline that ugly tangle of business logic and ludicrously outdated fare policy.(5) If we keep on the way we\\'re going, we\\'ll never know what we\\'re losing out on in price or value or features. MTC shut the door on simpler, better system of fares &amp; rules and therefore on vendors who might have saved us all money and made C2 experience better for everyone.(4) But, honestly, the slippery ease with which Cubic came into $0.5B of public money without competition, has got us mad. That part of us that\\'s fed up with bad regional leadership wants to demand that the sole bid be rejected and the project be re-structured.(3) There IS still time to recover some value from this bid. Streamlining biz rules &amp; fare policy before code gets pushed wd deliver a more cost-effective and reliable project, &amp; yield benefits in equity, ridership, environmental outcomes, customer experience.(2) When this advice was ignored, most vendors wisely dropped out. Any contractor that\\'s left standing after that, is not a contractor you want. Lo and behold, MTC is about to award 0.5B sole bid from a defense contractor with a side business in transit.(1) So, about this Clipper 2.0 thing: it\\'s pretty clear that @MTCBATA has fumbled the ball on a $0.5B contract. It was warned by vendors early on that not streamlining its 35k business rules and ludicrously complex fare policy was a recipe for disaster, yet chose to ignore.@graue @derivativeburke @graue we\\'re on it. So many missed opportunities here. It\\'s time we all stood up for better governance of regional transit: we agree w/ @SPUR_Urbanist that there\\'s a fare policy problem, but there\\'s also an expectations problem.

And, the board REALLY appreciated having six constituents present and wanting to speak - County Connection doesn\\'t get many commenters and they were welcomedAnd Board Chair Keith Haydon of Clayton talked about the importance of improving ease of use for transit users. Worth expessed concerns about ensuring that it\\'s not a zero sum game - better regional connex should not be done at the expense of local service...Ramacier commented that \"it is my hope that we will be able to be supportive.\" Board Member Amy Worth, who is an MTC Commissioner and sits on the task force, talked about the value of seamless service to help bring back ridership to transit and serve constituents..GM Rick Ramacier talked about ongoing work at the regional Blue Ribbon Transit Recover Task Force to recommend how to integrate the system and the likely prospect of legislation that Asm Chiu said at the task force he is looking to bringAt today\\'s County Connection board, six people who live in or have frequent trips to Central Contra Costa County spoke or wrote in about how helpful it would be to have more seamlessly integrated transit, complementary to the need for restored and improved local transit https://t.co/uTejtVhvvZSeeing clear commitment to additional future transit funding will give transit agencies the confidence to participate more fruitfully in discussions of fare integration and governance reforms.Saving transit will require a major new source of regional funds.

As we reset Phase II of BART to SV, let\\'s think long and hard where we want BART to go beyond Diridon. https://t.co/H4831nwV6BFinally, we need more progressive ways to fund transit, not just sales taxes. Regional parking levies, equitable congestion pricing, income tax surcharges for transit, and other progressive revenue sources need to be enabled thru future legislation.The current Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force is the right venue for governance discussions. We ask elected officials in the 3 counties to support that process, and the legislation that will come out of it, to develop holistic governance solutions for seamless transit.A 1/8 cent sales tax with no ‚Äúreturn to source‚Äù requirements is the best way to keep the system running through covid-19, with a commitment to a process to fix Caltrain governance so that the rail line is managed, planned, and funded as one line of an integrated regional system.Caltrain‚Äôs flawed governance needs to be fixed - we need to stop thinking of it as a stand-alone system. It needs to be governed and funded as part of a regionally integrated rail and bus system for the Bay Area - accountable to a Bay Area Transit network manager.Funding for regional transit should be allocated predictably, not be subject to local jurisdictions withholding funds in any given year, holding riders hostage. The new conditions proposed are the opposite of what Bay Area transit needs now to adapt to this crisis. https://t.co/dkkHReXYj0@TransitGeekJoe @RebeccaForBART @SFBART @sfmta_muni Thank you for your support Joe!‚ú®hopeüöÇ https://t.co/UZrbJIy7xkGreat thread. @Caltrain must evolve into an affordable, high frequency line seamlessly integrated into a multi-modal system.

A ‚Äútemporary‚Äù shutdown means permanent layoffs, permanent shifts in how people get around, and a permanent loss of faith among the public and employers in the reliability of transit.We hope the @sfbos now realizes that failing to act in July to authorize this measure will be a huge setback for sustainable transit in the Bay - severing the most direct transit link btwn our 2 largest job centers, leaving thousands of riders behind &amp; preventing a green recoveryBut there is no time to blame anyone for what‚Äôs already happened. We need to quickly figure out how to move forward and save this ballot measure so we can avoid a Caltrain shutdown.Based on info we gathered in the last 24 hrs, it seems that the onerous process for advancing this measure to the ballot - which required approval by 7 boards - resulted in confusion among some BoS members, &amp; many staff &amp; advocates, about the need for a cmte referral yesterdayMany Bay Area residents are understandably confused and upset after the SF Board of Supervisors yesterday declined to advance a ballot measure that could have provided stable funding for Caltrain and helped to avoid a prolonged shutdown.Tune in now: https://t.co/OFzTFAN21rWe are deeply disappointed in today\\'s decision by the Board.

(5) Balance regional and local interests; (6) Make sure this is linked to other broad policy policy objectives - climate, rail integrationDesmond from Sam Schwartz (consultant team) summarizes feedback from meetings: (1) Focus on outcomes - ridership, customer experience (2) Center customers (3) think boldly, and be courageous; don\\'t lose the momentum of the moment...McMillan - observation that when the NM discussion began, people thought that we\\'d be creating a NM upon a \\'recovered\\' transit system; however, we may need to shift our thinking toward NM as a framework overlaid on a permanently changed mobility landscape.Final item:  Guided discussion on priorities for the task force in evaluating NM options. https://t.co/zFxc9LtOeF6-7 members of the public make comments, mostly urging the advisory group to center the needs of riders - including both transit dependent riders and potential riders who might be attracted to transit. Also a request to use less jargon to make this more accessible to the public.Currier (Transform) - As we consider risk, let\\'s make sure we consider the risk to riders.  She will do her best to try to center the voices of riders and people with disabilities, who are underrepresented on this task force.McMillan:  Public sector is not always allowed to experiment or \\'fail\\'; this makes it more risk-averse (i.e. change-averse) - can the Business Case help evaluate this?McMillan - the outcome of this process must be better service to customers.  Big part of business case must be an \\'infrastructure\\' able to work and deliver these outcomes - the \\'bureaucracy\\' (institutions) that will do it must be identified. Include, staffing, resources, etc.Wunderman - this is a unique opportunity to put forth a bold vision - and possibly one of our last chances to put in place.Wunderman - there will never be enough money for transit.  For that reason if there are certain options for NM that require money, that shouldn\\'t be an obstacle to advancing it - let\\'s go out and find the money.Raad indicates that significant additional work has been done by the operators to further develop the \"network management options\", since the conclusion of the BRTF last fall.Management vs Manager options on the table https://t.co/BZPEdr8cVrTamim Raad of Access Planning introduces a the consultant team - the same one that served the Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force, bringing experience from across North America on governance.Dennis Mulligan of Golden Gate Transit has been elected as Chair, Alicia John-Baptiste of @SPUR_Urbanist as Vice-ChairStarting now: @MTCBATA\\'s kickoff meeting for the Network Management Business Case Advisory Group:  https://t.co/oGGvOSVBbVüí° NEW on our blog: Kenji Anzai explores how different German regions developed different forms of transit network managers, or verkehrsverb√ºnde, and delves into lessons these regions can provide for the Bay Area. ‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/MF5zhSYn7CRider voices are needed at this 1st meeting to show advisory group members how important this issue is to the Bay Area\\'s future - so please tune in &amp; speak up!\\n\\n&amp; sign up for our mailing list to make sure you get notified about future action opportunities: https://t.co/311IPwWrL2Over the next 9 months, this group and @MTCBATA  will determine how to reform Bay Area transit governance for the next generation.

Timed bus connections and free bus transfers would make ferries accessible to far more people and avoid the need for large parking lots at ferry terminals.@kerbyside @MTCBATA @mtcbata was arguably created to coordinate transit but its mandate was never very well defined, and it lacks authority. Transit agencies have no direct accountability to MTC so they do what they want. So MTC mostly acts as a convener.@Lesdoggg @Seamless_Care .@Lesdoggg we can only assume you are irate about the ridiculously inconvenient transfer between @sfbart and @sfmta_muni at Embarcadero and Civic Center. We feel you! Let‚Äôs break down those metal bars and integrate our transit fares.@mcplanner @MTCBATA To be clear, @MTCBATA actually was trying to advance fare integration. Those who voted against it were the Transit Agency GMs, who sit on the @BayAreaClipper Exec Board, which is operated out of @MTCBATA but has a different board. Sound confusing and unnecessarily complex? It is.Business-as-usual with Bay Area transit: @SFBART, @VTA, @caltrain and other general managers vote to delay action on integrating transit fares. https://t.co/HPIaMyN18kLet‚Äôs make sure the @SFBART Board selects a new GM who puts riders first and champions seamless transit. Our future depends on it.  https://t.co/SJfkRH94Sq. @StreetsblogSF @icgee@calisurf @BayAreaClipper @SPUR_Urbanist @bayrailalliance Each GM had a different suggestion as to ‚Äúwho else‚Äù needed to be consulted (e.g. small operators, staff, board members), on a topic that has been widely discussed since January, and which Clipper customers have asked for repeatedly in surveys. Why can‚Äôt leaders just lead?@davehod @thecliffbar @CalOccupier @Scott_Wiener @andrewchen We‚Äôre fighting hard for comprehensive solutions to improve Bay Area transit &amp; transportation, which requires addressing poor governance &amp; lack or regional leadership. $ alone won‚Äôt be enough; we must reform our institutions and so we get better mobility for our public dollars.The meeting perfectly demonstrated how lack of leadership or clear responsibility for regional transit leads us to repeatedly kick the can down the road to avoid taking any meaningful steps to integrate Bay Area transit or make it more affordable.All transit agency GMs took turns claiming ‚Äúnot enough consultation‚Äù had taken place. They don‚Äôt trust @MTCBATA to develop a scope of work for $600k.Very disappointing @BayAreaClipper Executive Board meeting today.  Transit Agency GMs vote to postpone approve funds for a business case study of fare integration until October, despite public comment in support from @seamlessbayarea, @SPUR_Urbanist, and @bayrailalliance.We are excited to be working with groups across the Bay Area to make sure new funding for transportation occurs alongside critical governance reforms.We agree major new transit funding is needed and support the concept of a major ballot measure. However to make good use of new funding, we must address our  governance of transportation, tie our investments to clear mobility goals and set up effective institutions..@mercnews + @EastBayTimes nailed it: ‚ÄúThe last thing we need is yet another ballot measure with a grab bag of projects. What‚Äôs needed is a holistic approach that integrates the Bay Area‚Äôs 26 bus, train + ferry agencies + 9 congestion management agencies.‚Äù https://t.co/kCE3i935MZ@tails_dorian Yes, that is the fundamental problem. We have never said that the solution is a single operator. Governance reform is needed to establish a central authority to set standards, do network planning, and coordinate multiple operators.  More info here:  https://t.co/BuY6Frr1FR‚ÄúWith so many railroads and operating agencies, who would ultimately run the new services? The hope is to make that transparent to the user.‚Äù  Hope?  We can‚Äôt pin our transit future on hopes, we need serious proposals for governance reform to create a seamless system! https://t.co/2aO9oCDRhx@SPUR_Urbanist @BayAreaCouncil @SVLeadershipGrp Agreed - and let‚Äôs make sure we create the right institutions to enable success!  More money on its own won‚Äôt solve our transit woes - we need governance reform to create a seamless, customer-focused system.@calisurf @SPUR_Urbanist It‚Äôs the tragedy of the commons and lack of leadership. Everyone acknowledges better regional governance is needed, yet without a compelling leader, we continue on the way we always have. We need strong, articulate champions of regionalism to overcome apathy and inertia.60 minutes to get between any two rail stations in the Bay Area?  Yes please! We‚Äôre excited about @SPUR_Urbanist‚Äôs vision for seamless megaregional rail. Check out our latest blog post: https://t.co/jpGSOVsjaH@hoverbird Transit Agencies do badly in UI and CX because they lack executive leadership in these areas. We recently wrote a blog post on this:  https://t.co/Q2qTzZyFBsNone of the Bay Area‚Äôs transit 27 agencies have a ‚ÄúChief Customer Officer‚Äù or departments dedicated to improving the customer experience of using transit.

We\\'d love to get your feedback about zones in our quick survey about the map (if you have a minute): https://t.co/izErwnWI0P@Eeeszy Our vision accounts for this - that\\'s why we propose that the cost for the first *two* zones is the same local base fare. That way any short trip of 7 miles or less will be no more than $2.20, even if you cross a zone boundary. https://t.co/SBITffwtM8Fired up about our Integrated Fare Vision Map and the possibility of a truly integrated fare system in the Bay Area? Your support can help make integrated fares a reality.\\n\\nMake a contribution today: https://t.co/yhTRAyrLhQ https://t.co/FXMAoR4TFl@BayBetter An important point.

We\\'d love for you to fill out our quick Vision Map survey, if you have a few minutes: https://t.co/izErwnWI0P@bryanculbertson Yes, ferries are part of this vision.

It\\'s free and open to all! https://t.co/2RLN1bwcWnWe hope our new map can accelerate a regional conversation about integrated fares in the Bay Area by making it easier to visualize how a comprehensive system of fares could work. \\n\\nRead all the details on our blog: https://t.co/PixVz2pr0Y https://t.co/b8tV4UpOVATransitioning to fully integrated fares would also require establishing a central regional authority with the ability to set fare policy, &amp; collect and distribute fare revenue to transit operators across the 9-county region.\\n\\nMore details about that here: https://t.co/P94GGBfgVVOur sketch-level financial analysis of the Integrated Fare Vision shows that regional fare revenue levels would remain similar to the pre-COVID status quo, but that the transit system would need add\\'l revenue to cover the additional discounts proposed for low income riders.Fare integration would be a highly beneficial long-term investment for the region. Earlier this year, MTC found that integrated fares were one of the most cost-effective projects we could invest in, attracting more people to transit &amp; reducing costs for low income people.Our Integrated Fare Vision resembles zone-based fare systems used in other regions‚Äîsuch as Zurich, Copenhagen, and greater Frankfurt‚Äî that have resulted in growing and widespread transit use in both urban and suburban areas. https://t.co/EK1bKinVeAOur Integrated Fare Vision would be a departure from the Bay Area‚Äôs current fragmented fare policies, in which riders pay additional fares &amp; are subject to different rules each time they transfer, which can make both local &amp; regional trips expensive and confusing ü§îDaily, weekly, and monthly fare caps would also give riders free additional trips once they take transit at least 2.5 times per day, 9 times a week, or 36 times per month ‚Äî eliminating the need for riders to decide before they travel whether to buy a high frequency pass. https://t.co/8NgwpPEfXdUnder our Integrated Fare Vision proposal, riders would be charged the same amount *no matter what mode of transit they use or how many times they transfer*, providing more predictability for riders while encouraging people to use the fastest route available. https://t.co/CynNkh04GPThe map divides the Bay Area into a series of 7-mile wide zones, each about the size of San Francisco. Fares are easy to calculate; riders simply count the minimum number of zones required to go between two points on the map, then look up the corresponding fare in the table. https://t.co/BYL0q8in8hToday, Seamless Bay Area is unveiling a map of our Integrated Transit Fare Vision ‚Äî a fully unified system of transit fares that would enable riders to travel seamlessly across the nine-county Bay Area with a single transit fare and free transfers üó∫Ô∏è https://t.co/P94GGBfgVV https://t.co/J1Yh89BzE4Read more on our blog: https://t.co/agBBiq41nf\\n\\nAnd thank you to our forum co-hosts @SFTRU, @ylinstitute, @alevin &amp; Friends of Caltrain, @SVYouthClimateA, @TransitRidersEB , and United Seniors of Oakland and Alameda County!Two riders currently living in one-car households reported that they were now considering buying a second car due to challenges riding transit in the Bay Area during the pandemic.One Sonoma County resident and transit rider reported that she had been forced to turn down a swing shift job because local buses are now only operating until 6:00 p.m., making it impossible for her to travel there and back.Riders reported ‚Äúlarge gaps‚Äù between buses on lines where service used to be more frequent, longer commutes, and challenges getting to work and to the airport.Takeaways from our Bay Area Transit Rider Forum on Oct. 15, focused on service changes and connectivity:\\n\\nAmong riders who have used transit regularly since March, many have experienced significant changes in their travel experience due to service cuts. https://t.co/agBBiq41nf‚òéÔ∏è On Oct. 28, we\\'re joining @SPUR_Urbanist &amp; Asm. @DavidChiu for a special phone bank supporting #MeasureRR! \\n\\nWe\\'d love to see you there - tools &amp; training will be provided: https://t.co/ukfiBdkcVw\\n\\nCan\\'t make it?

Together, unified Bay Area transit wayfinding and fares can signifcantly increase transit ridership and access. \\nNew on our blog:\\nhttps://t.co/mDvbC9OZvtFare and wayfinding integration are extremely popular with stratospheric poll results, so a proposal for streamlined fares and signage would help pass a ballot measure https://t.co/YNJFaPED8gThe study shows that fare integration would have costs, and deeper levels of integration cost more, but would be a cost-effective way to gain ridership.  MTC is considering convening a process for transit funding (for 2024+), so that will be an opportunity to fund integration...@_Nataliea schedule integration is also needed but is separate and not covered in the fare integration study. So if schedules are integrated the results will be better.If you would like to weigh in on Bay Area fare integration, the Fare Integration Task Force is getting an update today at 12:30pm. The Zoom link is https://t.co/ho7uk5iNJv Suggestions for crafting your own comments https://t.co/psvACpzAV5And, full fare integration would be able to unlock hundreds of additional millions in benefits by streamlining wayfinding/signage https://t.co/GlpGaJ1UNXThe study also shows that fare integration is an effecitve way to reduce driving. Standardizing regional fares or fully integrating fares would reduce driving 4x as much as Caltrain electrification, which is famed for being able to replace the need for 5 freeway lanes https://t.co/LTjmEJNy2NAnd the study shows that fare integration is a very cost-effective way to grow ridership - much more cost-effective than many other transit investments.... https://t.co/SOGXA9rOZlFree transfers would generate over 25,000 new trips, as much or more ridership as flagship bus likes such as the AC Transit 51 lines.  Standardized regional fares and/or full integration would generate as much or more ridership than Caltrain pre-Covid https://t.co/cU2HzRwlFLNew regional fare integration study indicates that fare integration would likely result in notable transit ridership increases.  \\nhttps://t.co/XohYTJg5ynüì£ Happening in 3 days: our exclusive #TransitMonth conversation w/ @christofspieler about how transit can be better connected &amp; more accessible. üôå\\n\\nBonus: we‚Äôll be offering special book deals!

Is that complicated? Yes, it is..@icgee: Putting this system into place would require reforms to our current system, including establishing a central regional authority that would administer fares and policies\"Under our proposal, any trip within 1 or 2 zones is a local fare price, so short trips aren\\'t penalized.\" @icgeeSeamless policy director @icgee: The Bay Area\\'s existing fare system has problems with complexity, equity, and inefficiency - and isn\\'t aligned with broader mobility goals\"A good fare system supports equity.

The passage of Measure RR is an important step in the right direction.This week, these collective efforts paid off, with Bay Area residents voting resoundingly to fund Caltrain service and enable Caltrain to continue to serve the workers and communities who rely on it.This summer, this diverse coalition came together to keep Caltrain\\'s funding measure headed to the ballot üòÖ And over the past three months, Measure RR supporters made 15,000+ calls to voters, sent 135,000 text messages, &amp; dropped tens of thousands of fliers across the Bay Area.This outcome would not have been possible without the commitment, vision, and leadership of Bay Area community leaders, advocates, and volunteers. üëè https://t.co/GU8ZONZMBJWe‚Äôre thrilled that Bay Area voters stood together to decisively pass #MeasureRR and rescue Caltrain.

Lack of integrated routes, fares and schedules makes transit costly and inconvenient, forcing many to own cars and drive.Public transit is one of the best possible investments we can make in reducing inequality and poverty.  Imagine if poor Americans had 22.5% more income to spend on other things.Lack of quality public transit hurts poor people most, forcing many into expensive car ownership.\\n\\nUS: The poorest 20% spend 29% of income on transportation - mostly vehicle ownership costs because transit is so poor.\\n\\nEurope: The poorest 20% spend just 7.5% on transportation. https://t.co/wpgJqJ3UQw‚ÄúThe metro area lacks a shared aspiration and commitment to making its collective public transit network the best and most convenient option for a greater share of trips, nor does it have the mechanisms in place to deliver such a vision.‚Äù DC, we feel your pain.The movement for seamless transit is growing nationwide.

Voluntary collaboration is unlikely to be enough - we need to think of where we have leverage.((in the 1 minute provided for public comment, Seamless commented on the importance of creating a unified regional operator in improving project delivery))public comment happening now3 key questions:  (1) Should MTC set up a standard risk oversight process for megaprojects? (2) Should MTC implement a stage gate process?  (3) Should MTC condition funding on policy compliance?  If so what policies rise to the top? https://t.co/j35q1dBPF9Final discussion period:  What\\'s MTC\\'s role?  Pedroza:  Key question is how to implementing partners see MTC\\'s role as additive, and not a hostile takeover?Now for the Megaproject Advancement Program. Kenneth Folan summarizes feedback from Commissioners - when costs change, cost-benefit should be reassessed. And there\\'s a highlight on risk management strategies...Abe-Koga - perhaps not as oversight but as a resource to vet best practices, technologies. I shy away from the word oversight, I don\\'t want to add more layers of bureaucracy.They could get paid for from the projects, defining cost, scope with a sense of objectivity ((I like the metaphor of a circuit rider rather than a mercenary))Liccardo, since we have FTA, additional oversight is not needed.  Refers to Josefowitz comments about experience and optimism bias.  MTC could staff a pool of project management professionals with experience with big projects.Chavez - adding extra layers adds complexity. Could instead we have more best practices to draw on from a regional level, for example with grade separations.  We should be a regional catalyst that creates opportunities for things we do in our communities....Commissioner Chavez - what is an example? McMillan\\'s answer includes looking at the landscape and seeing what foundational capabilities might be missing ((such as integrated regional rail?))but even for the projects in the works, there is a role to play for oversight processes beyond what\\'s provided by FTA - stage gate processes, independent peer reviews.and asks what role to play with regard to projects that are already in progress, in a way that does not add cost and delay...Vice Chair Josefowitz envisions a greater role for future projects starting with a connected network plan to ensure projects that build together in a good sequence...Spering calls on consultant to focus on what is best for the customer, not what existing constraints are.  We get too hung up on what works for operators - we must get beyond this.  Let\\'s know what legislative changes are needed.Now Kate White of @ArupGroup facilitates a discussion among the Commission on what should MTC\\'s role be?Back to Dawson who presents the timeline of the Rail Partnerships study.  Alternative assessment findings will feed into Network Management business case study.  ((Will a merged regional operator become one of the logical opportunities for a network manager?)) https://t.co/upJwKnM2RwCommon features - Layering of different organizations; Constant evolution over time.Success factors:  Developing necessary resources &amp; expertises; develop more systematic approach to innovation - Crossrail in particular led to a number of ongoing programs to share best practices more broadly within the sector.Once projects are complete from these special purpose entities, assets are transferred back to TfL or Network Rail.Gold also notes that London has also had a lot of evolution over time (like Toronto); layering in London:  TfL sets objectives for projects;  Network Rail operates many services and delivers many major projects;  HS2 and Crossrail are special purpose delivery vehicles. https://t.co/qHET72iTmfRaquel gold describes the \\'layering\\' of various entities in greater Toronto - a provincial project delivery advisory entity, Infrastructure Ontario - a region-wide combined operator and project owner, Metrolinx (which includes GO Transit); and a local operator, TTC. https://t.co/jPGTtpwsyJRaquel Gold of consultant team takes over to introduce reference models for the bay area - greater Toronto, and greater London. https://t.co/57l9zxc2d8Lines of inquiry for this study:  Understanding suitability of existing structures in delivering on our many ambitions. https://t.co/PHHHPm627RAlaistair Dawson of @Steer_Group takes over; caveats that this study is in \\'exploratory\\' mode, and will stop short of making recommendations. https://t.co/wNcthSSJRbNow for the long awaited study - McMillan describes that the $400k planning grant MTC received to explore potential different governance and delivery structures to achieve a more effective and seamless rail network.  Steer was selected as consultant.MTC has also more direct project delivery role as a builder - for Bay Bridge, Express Lanes, Electronic Tolling infrastructure.  Not so much on transit today though.McMillan:  MTC\\'s current role in megaprojects is both as  a funder and an investor.  Investor refers to $$ that is fully within MTC\\'s authority, i.e. RM 1, 2, or 3 funds.  This implies a bigger role for MTC\\'s involvement.(public comment will be at the very end of the workshop, probably this afternoon sometime. But this is an important presentation to watch. We\\'ll attempt to summarize key points here)Happening now: \\nMTC\\'s role in getting major projects delivered, with Executive Director Therese McMillan and the consultants from Steer giving the first preview of the long awaited Regional Rail Partnerships Governance &amp; Delivery study.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/LITAzCJ0SkLastly, in your public comment, feel free to use any of the talking points in the letter we submitted with @JointVentureSVN: https://t.co/1t8teFnXZq\\nAsk @MTCBATA to do a detailed study on the costs &amp; benefits of a BART-Caltrain merger as a next step to the Regional Rail study.For more reasons why we think a unified rail operator - bringing together @SFBART and @Caltrain under one unified board - check out our blog post:  https://t.co/BpgAeCnXFfHere\\'s the full agenda:\\nhttps://t.co/7o1p85NCsm\\n\\nAnd here\\'s the zoom link to make a comment.\\nhttps://t.co/LITAzCJ0SkToday @MTCBATA is having a workshop on how to improve megaproject delivery.

Speak up during Item #3 ~10:30-11:30am if you agree https://t.co/llGBumCbTZMotion to enable 2 hour free transfers and assess whether there is a Title VI problem (equity problem). If no problem, move ahead.  If there\\'s a potential problem, bring it back to the board.Board member Peeples asks what % of people are using the mobile app vs. Clipper. Answer - about 1% are using the app...Board member Young is asking why free transfers is needed when there is a day pass with 3 trips per day. Director Shaw says that sometimes she takes the bus one way and takes BART in the other direction...Staff is saying that the mobile app already allows free transfers within 90 minutes because when you enable a ticket it\\'s good for 90 minutes automatically - so they could change that to 2 hours without having to wait for Clipper...the Clipper project is saying that this feature won\\'t be available until Clipper 2.0 in 2023 (which is reasonable), but that intra-agency transfers won\\'t be available until even later than that (which is not reasonable)The AC Transit item on free bus to bus transfers is up now - this is the Zoom link to dial in and make public comment https://t.co/4Q0zh5MHz8 https://t.co/IkmsnKBgpGThe board changed the order of the meeting.

Mulligan closes the meeting - June 6th is next meeting!Tumlin:  \"Representativeness\" is an important concept - both of riders and of the population.  Muni has half the transit riders, SF is 75% of the origins/destinations in the region. How do we balance the need for geographic equity vs. set of needs for urban operators?McMillan:  This is a good summary of the essential elements. It\\'s important to also recognize that these are stretch goals - where we should be headed - and it\\'s OK that that\\'s not where we are yet.Final part of the discussion:  Consultant team wants reactions on draft principles for entity design. https://t.co/YCR9vmDVoyFor example, blind passengers want to see standards for auditory queues across transit - on both regional and local service.Levin - Agrees with John-Baptiste that it\\'s difficult to distinguish so distinctly between regional and local accountabilities when riders are reliant on all parts of the system to make a journey.Vice Chair John-Baptiste - What is our highest level goal with this?  Answer:  Transit must be the top choice for people, the easiest thing for people to choose.  This is necessary to then answer the question, \"what is regional vs. local\" - in reality it\\'s hard to separate the 2.Currier - Key goal of RNM should to create the feeling of one unified system for riders.  RNM should take responsibility for equity regionally - serving concentrations of low income riders is not solely a local responsibility but a regional responsibility.Bouchard - Caltrain\\'s challenge is that it\\'s clearly a regional service but with impacts in a very local way - how is this handled? Notes the importance of highlighting what is the intersection between the parallel Regional Rail Partnership\\'s study underway.Wunderman - disagrees with a slide in the packet that suggests that fares are a local responsibility - this seems out of step with MTC business case - asks for clarification. Especially with a new source of funding, fares can become a regional accountability - and should be.McMillan - key question is what is \\'regionally significant\\' is very important - and can change over time based on circumstance. For example, a major local project might be considered local; but the moment it applies for regional money due to cost overruns, it becomes regional.Desmond (from consultant team) noted that another ad hoc committee emerging consensus was both \"do no harm\" -- but also don\\'t use that as an excuse for not changing.Raad: Remarkable degree of alignment from ad hoc committee members on right division of accountabilites between RNM and local operators on infrastructure development, design, and delivery.  Key Q is what constitutes a \\'major\\' project requiring regional accountability? https://t.co/7Lbd9OxLdkNow a discussion of accountabilities and authorities of a network manager....Familiar graphic, reprised from Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force - highighting which accountabilities (orange/red colors) require more direct authority from a centralized entity. https://t.co/HRmV7tJMOSRaad notes that accountabilities do not always match authorities - and this creates problems.  Creating a match is a key goal of governance reform.Authority = what powers does an entity hold to enable an accountable entity to carry out its assigned duties/obligations.Accountability = what entity is accountable for certain outcomes (i.e. integrated fares).Next Up: Discussion of what accountabilities and authorities of what a regional network manager (RNM) should be.Task force members compliment consultants on graphics and how these can be tools in helping us evaluate network management structures later on in the process.Raad: Fragmented landscape has been somewhat effective at meeting some local needs for funding, but not sufficient for regional needs.Another amazing slide summarizing complex funding sources, i.e. the root of the challenge. https://t.co/TJTTHIAnTRRaad:  Much transit agency ridership is local, but given how many regional trips are happening in cars, question is whether some amount of potential transit ridership is being \\'left on the table\\'? https://t.co/1DZjzBgR3TTamim Raad of Access planning (consultant team) is sharing some amazing visualizations of the Bay Area\\'s complex transit agency landscape https://t.co/KtryzTl537Network Management Business Case Advisory Committee happening now!

People are moving to the Central Valley, we should be focusing on travel to Tracy for affordable housing...Gonot - we want to work in coordination with MTC but transit agencies are so different, our funding sources are diverse. We could maybe accomplish it in 10 years.There are a lot of people from outside the county who work here and we want to make that easier.  We should say \"both and\" - we want it to work, and we want to set our conditions...We\\'ve got lots of reasons to gripe, and we\\'re perceived as having a reputation for griping....Liccardo - I am afraid about the reputation we are getting for not being good regional collaborators...Lawson - our third fear is taking funding away from local operations. An example \"come up with a common format for real-time data\" - but the standard could change, and then we would need to change, and that would take money away from service....Mayor Liccardo.  I want to be clear about what are our fears - the loss of STA funding with noncompliance, the lack of representation on MTC. What else do we fear?...Lawson response to \"why are we looking only at one option.\" Sen Becker has recently introduced a bill SB917, with things we support - fares, wayfinding, tranfers. But it will be done by MTC, and if not agencies will be ineligible for STA funds ((this is a power MTC already has))Abe-Koga - the question is where the money would come from ((seamless transit polls at ~90% and is important to get future funding from voters))...We do want to serve our riders as seamlessly as possible... we\\'ve been hearing about input from riders, this  is important ((and how can riders give feedback when they use VTA and BART?))Abe-Koga - we\\'re trying to do a one size fits all approach. Earlier on I had thought that consolidation might make sense, but it\\'s not as easy as it might seem....The goal should be to respect the fact that there are 27 agencies with separate fiduciary responsibilities to taxpayers ((but what about when the taxpayers want service that is seamless across agencies?))What motivated this? Agencies working together to respond to Covid, being aware that there are 27 agencies with 27 boards and different sources of funding...We thought that the agencies putting service on the streets and should be the ones working together to get it done...Abe-Koga - what brought the GMs to bring this forward now, and what induced the GMs to come up with this \"preferred alternative\"Gonot - the first funding comes from federal relief money, and this is new money. We don\\'t want to take money away from local trips to fund regional service ((this has not been proposed anywhere)).And Hendricks wants to know more about the roles and responsibilities sooner rather than later...Hendricks - what is the definition of success? How do we know it did a good thing. Is anyone looking at that? Haywood - it\\'s early in the process. Different counties might have different goals....Hendricks - we are already aligning VTA service hours to connect to BART.  I\\'m looking for more clarity on what the practical change it would mean to us...It might affect signage and fares, where our board would no longer have the authority to set our own fares....Director Hendricks - can you explain what the change would be for VTA.  Haywood.  If the network manager required a transfer, we might have to run the service to make the transfer, instead of putting the service where we think it belongs...Chavez - I believe the goal is to do a better job of serving the public - in a self-help county...It feels to me like the direction MTC is going would be a greater barrier to us as a South Bay Region.Chavez - Santa Clara County is 25% of population but we\\'ve had a difficult time getting money to our county...Ramacier says that the operator option is similar to Clipper Executive Board with a broader range of operation....Gonot asks to for comparison with Clipper Executive Board.  Ramacier says this is similar, but CEB is focused on fare payment.Staff characterizes the alternative which would be a new body that could impose requirements on the transit agencies.Director Chavez - \"I have not felt that there are alternatives\" ((right they haven\\'t been put forward yet))Staff - we will bring back the other alternatives also.  Peralez - we are moving in the right direction, but we should look at alternatives taking into account models around the countryCM Peralez asks for the board to see all of the options rather than to comment on one alternative, which staff had framed as a \"preferred alternative\"CM Peralez supports better transit coordination for riders even if this means agencies giving up some local control...VTA staff notes that most commute trips in Santa Clara County are intra-county, so transfers are less important in Santa Clara CountyThe model involves and advisory board where stakeholders advice a body composed of transit agency staff.    The model where stakeholders advice staff is the least powerful type of guidance.The proposal allows existing boards to retain their authorities, and changes will need to continue to go to 27 boards and MTC to make new policy refinementsVTA board is getting an update on the Bay Area\\'s Transportation Network Management study.  But they are showing only one option, which is the option closest to the status quo....We have an infrastructure crisis in the Bay Area. The need for reform, particularly in project delivery, has never been more obvious. https://t.co/UbTmlWtN9IBART and AC Transit Board Members seek rider-centric governance options to coordinate the region\\'s transit system, and call for fair consideration of multiple options.\\nhttps://t.co/PagEkJDYaGüö® Join us TONIGHT at 6:00 p.m. PT for a lively conversation about customer information experiences on transit! \\n\\nRSVP here: https://t.co/lQEUXJf85I https://t.co/lYwGNorgpYSeamless supporters can attend tomorrow\\'s @SPUR_Urbanist panel for free using the code SEAMLESS22 ‚ú®‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/ifQ7y7qXpjüìå TOMORROW: Join us at 6:00 pm PT to hear from industry experts about how to create a better customer information experience on transit! \\n\\nNot too late to RSVP ‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/lQEUXJf85I https://t.co/wPecNVYUqQ#SB917, @SenJoshBecker\\'s new seamless transit bill, could accelerate the arrival of free transfers, an all-agency transit pass, and a regional fare structure. \\n\\nThese would be major improvements for riders! üöÜüöåüöãüöè‚õ¥Ô∏è\\n\\nRead more via @StreetsblogSF:   https://t.co/CxzRIK5grvAre you interested in how to use design &amp; engineering to deliver better information to transit riders? üöÜüöåüöè\\n\\nJoin us on Feb. 17 at 6:00 p.m. PT for a lively virtual conversation with experts from @sfmta_muni, @LIRR, &amp; @SwiftlyInc!

It builds on previous bills we\\'ve championed, as well as the recent work of the Bay Area Transit Recovery Task Force.Data show that these policies could increase transit ridership by tens of thousands of new daily riders, eliminate hundreds of thousands of daily driving miles from roads, &amp; help address longstanding transit coordination and service challenges in the Bay Area.üöÑüöçüöèüå≥#SB917 would require Bay Area transit agencies to work together to develop an integrated transit fare structure by 2024, a Connected Network Plan to support schedule coordination and service standards, and a single regional transit map and standardized wayfinding system.üëèüëèüì£ BREAKING NEWS üì£ \\n\\nThis morning, @SenJoshBecker introduced #SB917, the Seamless Transit Transformation Act, a new bill to create a more coordinated &amp; integrated Bay Area transit system, while improving the rider experience. üßµ https://t.co/Sntu8YXYZW https://t.co/kgcqzOODE2@_Nataliea Thanks for letting us know.

Let us know, and let\\'s get to work üí™ https://t.co/vmJdvuqiZ6(10/x) In summary, our message to Ms McMillan is this: Welcome back to the Bay Area! There\\'s a lot to do, and we‚Äôre here to help in any way we can.\\nWe look forward to partnering with you to make Bay Area transit more seamless, unified, and effective for riders. üôÇüöâ‚ú®(9/x) We all know the need is great, and that riders are experiencing the pain every single day. Fare integration would save riders $$; service integration would give riders back valuable time in life; and branding integration would save riders significant confusion/headache.(8/x) Capital planning cannot just be based on the preferences of local politicians and individual agencies. The previous leadership was too often an enabler of projects with dubious regional value.(7/x) With a new focus on customer experience bedded in, we think the MTC ED should then turn to restructuring capital planning in the region: this should be based on regional outcomes ‚Äî moving a certain number of people to destinations in a certain amount of time, for example(6/x) A rider should be able to move across the system without being punished financially, getting stuck at transfer points, and struggling to physically find their way. #seamlesstransit(5/x) We think this work should start with integrating fares, schedules and wayfinding. These are the most basic \"table stakes\" to qualify as having a world-class transit system.(4/x) Under prior leadership, implementation of regional vision ‚Äî such as it was ‚Äî lacked urgency, coherence and the kind of tough-minded attitude needed to corral so many agencies and regional leaders.(3/x) Once the vision is in place, we‚Äôd love to see Ms McMillan roll up her sleeves and get to the critical work of delivering change in accordance with that vision.(2/x) First, she should to propose and commit to a bold and inspiring vision for a seamlessly-integrated, customer-oriented, outcomes-driven transportation system, and to radical/direct honesty about the investments and governance reforms needed to get us there.(1/x) We have big hopes for Therese W McMillan, incoming Exec Director of @MTCBATA!\\n\\ntl;dr version: We want the MTC ED to step up as a true regional leader, and we look forward to partnering with her to advance the necessary governance and policy reforms that our region needs.Congrats to Therese W McMillan on being named the new Executive Director of @MTCBATA!

But we recognize that these are unprecedented circumstances, and that California legislators are focused on the most essential public health and safety measures at this time.Unfortunately, the COVID-19 crisis has upended the landscape for new legislation in CA.

Staff - standardizing regional fares performs well on our metrics - in order to bring this about, we need governance and funding structures...Ames also supports expanding to ACE/CC/San Joaquin...Director Ames. This is a no-brainer.  I hope we implement tier 3 (standardizing regional fares) as soon as possible - BART, Caltrain, regional bus, ferry....Saltzman - this strongly supports our TOD goals.   With longterm changes in office commuting, fare integration will help support a greater diversity of trips and riders.  Saltzman wants the board to take a resolution when appropriate...Saltzman - we had an attempt to do BART-AC Transit tranfers and learned that this is something that 2 agencies can\\'t do alone....Director Saltzman - it is exciting to see recommendations we can use, some very soon and some later.

Nominate them for a Rider-First Award! https://t.co/9Gj3i8y6KX @SFTRU https://t.co/lf0bH7TGNLOur BART Board Candidate Forum (District 8) is coming up, tomorrow at 6 PM! Come hear from the candidates - how will they address the challenges BART is facing? What do they see for the future of BART on a regional level? Co-hosted w/ @SFTRU https://t.co/ip7Nd2d25K https://t.co/OhvhNflfs1(8) All this make you mad? Head over to MTC - meeting now Demand streamlined fare policies, simplified biz rules,  a focus on the rider's experience. Demand that contracts be properly value engineered. Even demand a re-bid. But definitely demand real regional leadership.(7) SO what to do? Asking for a re-bid WILL drag out a long C2 process even longer. BUT: isn't it time we had higher expectations? What if we didn't just throw our hands up in the air, hope for better next time? Unless we hold MTC to account, next time will never be better.(6) By re-structuring the proposal, we could even ask for better integration, a focus on rider needs not MTC or transit agency needs, and a chance to streamline that ugly tangle of business logic and ludicrously outdated fare policy.(5) If we keep on the way we're going, we'll never know what we're losing out on in price or value or features. MTC shut the door on simpler, better system of fares &amp; rules and therefore on vendors who might have saved us all money and made C2 experience better for everyone.(4) But, honestly, the slippery ease with which Cubic came into $0.5B of public money without competition, has got us mad. That part of us that's fed up with bad regional leadership wants to demand that the sole bid be rejected and the project be re-structured.(3) There IS still time to recover some value from this bid. Streamlining biz rules &amp; fare policy before code gets pushed wd deliver a more cost-effective and reliable project, &amp; yield benefits in equity, ridership, environmental outcomes, customer experience.(2) When this advice was ignored, most vendors wisely dropped out. Any contractor that's left standing after that, is not a contractor you want. Lo and behold, MTC is about to award 0.5B sole bid from a defense contractor with a side business in transit.(1) So, about this Clipper 2.0 thing: it's pretty clear that @MTCBATA has fumbled the ball on a $0.5B contract. It was warned by vendors early on that not streamlining its 35k business rules and ludicrously complex fare policy was a recipe for disaster, yet chose to ignore.@graue @derivativeburke @graue we're on it. So many missed opportunities here. It's time we all stood up for better governance of regional transit: we agree w/ @SPUR_Urbanist that there's a fare policy problem, but there's also an expectations problem. Government contracting should work better, period.Are you interested in supporting the work we're doing to develop a seamless transportation system in the Bay Area?

Our best option for achieving this is committing to the regional transit governance reform efforts currently underway, in partnership w/ local &amp; state elected officials seeking to build a seamless, regional systemWe support a ‚Äúclean‚Äù ballot measure that provides stable funding for Caltrain service and won‚Äôt confuse voters.Later today, the @SFBOS will vote on a revised #Caltrain ballot measure resolution. We're pleased that this measure was revived, but concerned that - as currently worded - it will not allocate funds predictably and could even halt Caltrain funding after two years.@sp6runderrated @alevin Seamless Transit by @SPUR_Urbanist is excellent background reading:  https://t.co/jkyrBMhfzbRegional housing + transportation challenges are inextricably linked. \"We‚Äôve punted the important structural reforms that will enable us to manage an effective transit system.

Agenda item #26: https://t.co/lqdpPhaSfNACTION ALERT: Tomorrow, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors will decide whether to support the ballot measure that will fund Caltrain &amp; prevent a shutdown. \n\nLive in SCC? Write to the Board *tonight* &amp; tell them to support the Caltrain measure: https://t.co/Q6A8UYA5vnOur rapid transit network needs to be planned and managed at a regional scale.  \n\nWe need an accountable üëè Bay üëè Area üëè Transit üëè Network üëè Manager.Now more than ever we must spend our transit dollars wisely. @Caltrain and @SFBART shouldn't be competing for riders at the same stations - they should run integrated service. As we reset Phase II of BART to SV, let's think long and hard where we want BART to go beyond Diridon. https://t.co/H4831nwV6BFinally, we need more progressive ways to fund transit, not just sales taxes. Regional parking levies, equitable congestion pricing, income tax surcharges for transit, and other progressive revenue sources need to be enabled thru future legislation.The current Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force is the right venue for governance discussions. We ask elected officials in the 3 counties to support that process, and the legislation that will come out of it, to develop holistic governance solutions for seamless transit.A 1/8 cent sales tax with no ‚Äúreturn to source‚Äù requirements is the best way to keep the system running through covid-19, with a commitment to a process to fix Caltrain governance so that the rail line is managed, planned, and funded as one line of an integrated regional system.Caltrain‚Äôs flawed governance needs to be fixed - we need to stop thinking of it as a stand-alone system. It needs to be governed and funded as part of a regionally integrated rail and bus system for the Bay Area - accountable to a Bay Area Transit network manager.Funding for regional transit should be allocated predictably, not be subject to local jurisdictions withholding funds in any given year, holding riders hostage. The new conditions proposed are the opposite of what Bay Area transit needs now to adapt to this crisis. https://t.co/dkkHReXYj0@TransitGeekJoe @RebeccaForBART @SFBART @sfmta_muni Thank you for your support Joe!‚ú®hopeüöÇ https://t.co/UZrbJIy7xkGreat thread. @Caltrain must evolve into an affordable, high frequency line seamlessly integrated into a multi-modal system.

Here's what they said: https://t.co/rrqAcR9MGJ@MattHaneySF Thank you for your leadership! We believe the current Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force is an important part of developing better regional governance. We look forward to working with you and the rest of the @sfbos on moving to a better model.If you're concerned, we encourage you to connect with @seamlessbayarea &amp; support our advocacy for integrated regional transit that truly serves ridersüôå\n\nLearn more about us: https://t.co/0ssf35961Y \nMake a contribution: https://t.co/N7FIk6W5BSWe must introduce state legislation as soon as we can that creates a more accountable, resilient, and rider-focused structure that ensures we don't accidentally lose entire parts of our transit network.This episode demonstrates not only the urgency of stable funding for Caltrain, but of addressing the structural governance issues of our regional transit system through the Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force.Caltrain can't just shut off for a few months and back on again like a light switch. A ‚Äútemporary‚Äù shutdown means permanent layoffs, permanent shifts in how people get around, and a permanent loss of faith among the public and employers in the reliability of transit.We hope the @sfbos now realizes that failing to act in July to authorize this measure will be a huge setback for sustainable transit in the Bay - severing the most direct transit link btwn our 2 largest job centers, leaving thousands of riders behind &amp; preventing a green recoveryBut there is no time to blame anyone for what‚Äôs already happened. We need to quickly figure out how to move forward and save this ballot measure so we can avoid a Caltrain shutdown.Based on info we gathered in the last 24 hrs, it seems that the onerous process for advancing this measure to the ballot - which required approval by 7 boards - resulted in confusion among some BoS members, &amp; many staff &amp; advocates, about the need for a cmte referral yesterdayMany Bay Area residents are understandably confused and upset after the SF Board of Supervisors yesterday declined to advance a ballot measure that could have provided stable funding for Caltrain and helped to avoid a prolonged shutdown.Tune in now: https://t.co/OFzTFAN21rWe are deeply disappointed in today's decision by the Board.

(5) Balance regional and local interests; (6) Make sure this is linked to other broad policy policy objectives - climate, rail integrationDesmond from Sam Schwartz (consultant team) summarizes feedback from meetings: (1) Focus on outcomes - ridership, customer experience (2) Center customers (3) think boldly, and be courageous; don't lose the momentum of the moment...McMillan - observation that when the NM discussion began, people thought that we'd be creating a NM upon a 'recovered' transit system; however, we may need to shift our thinking toward NM as a framework overlaid on a permanently changed mobility landscape.Final item:  Guided discussion on priorities for the task force in evaluating NM options. https://t.co/zFxc9LtOeF6-7 members of the public make comments, mostly urging the advisory group to center the needs of riders - including both transit dependent riders and potential riders who might be attracted to transit. Also a request to use less jargon to make this more accessible to the public.Currier (Transform) - As we consider risk, let's make sure we consider the risk to riders.  She will do her best to try to center the voices of riders and people with disabilities, who are underrepresented on this task force.McMillan:  Public sector is not always allowed to experiment or 'fail'; this makes it more risk-averse (i.e. change-averse) - can the Business Case help evaluate this?McMillan - the outcome of this process must be better service to customers.  Big part of business case must be an 'infrastructure' able to work and deliver these outcomes - the 'bureaucracy' (institutions) that will do it must be identified.

Timed bus connections and free bus transfers would make ferries accessible to far more people and avoid the need for large parking lots at ferry terminals.@kerbyside @MTCBATA @mtcbata was arguably created to coordinate transit but its mandate was never very well defined, and it lacks authority. Transit agencies have no direct accountability to MTC so they do what they want. So MTC mostly acts as a convener.@Lesdoggg @Seamless_Care .@Lesdoggg we can only assume you are irate about the ridiculously inconvenient transfer between @sfbart and @sfmta_muni at Embarcadero and Civic Center. We feel you! Let‚Äôs break down those metal bars and integrate our transit fares.@mcplanner @MTCBATA To be clear, @MTCBATA actually was trying to advance fare integration. Those who voted against it were the Transit Agency GMs, who sit on the @BayAreaClipper Exec Board, which is operated out of @MTCBATA but has a different board. Sound confusing and unnecessarily complex? It is.Business-as-usual with Bay Area transit: @SFBART, @VTA, @caltrain and other general managers vote to delay action on integrating transit fares. https://t.co/HPIaMyN18kLet‚Äôs make sure the @SFBART Board selects a new GM who puts riders first and champions seamless transit. Our future depends on it.  https://t.co/SJfkRH94Sq. @StreetsblogSF @icgee@calisurf @BayAreaClipper @SPUR_Urbanist @bayrailalliance Each GM had a different suggestion as to ‚Äúwho else‚Äù needed to be consulted (e.g. small operators, staff, board members), on a topic that has been widely discussed since January, and which Clipper customers have asked for repeatedly in surveys. Why can‚Äôt leaders just lead?@davehod @thecliffbar @CalOccupier @Scott_Wiener @andrewchen We‚Äôre fighting hard for comprehensive solutions to improve Bay Area transit &amp; transportation, which requires addressing poor governance &amp; lack or regional leadership. $ alone won‚Äôt be enough; we must reform our institutions and so we get better mobility for our public dollars.The meeting perfectly demonstrated how lack of leadership or clear responsibility for regional transit leads us to repeatedly kick the can down the road to avoid taking any meaningful steps to integrate Bay Area transit or make it more affordable.All transit agency GMs took turns claiming ‚Äúnot enough consultation‚Äù had taken place. They don‚Äôt trust @MTCBATA to develop a scope of work for $600k.Very disappointing @BayAreaClipper Executive Board meeting today.  Transit Agency GMs vote to postpone approve funds for a business case study of fare integration until October, despite public comment in support from @seamlessbayarea, @SPUR_Urbanist, and @bayrailalliance.We are excited to be working with groups across the Bay Area to make sure new funding for transportation occurs alongside critical governance reforms.We agree major new transit funding is needed and support the concept of a major ballot measure. However to make good use of new funding, we must address our  governance of transportation, tie our investments to clear mobility goals and set up effective institutions..@mercnews + @EastBayTimes nailed it: ‚ÄúThe last thing we need is yet another ballot measure with a grab bag of projects. What‚Äôs needed is a holistic approach that integrates the Bay Area‚Äôs 26 bus, train + ferry agencies + 9 congestion management agencies.‚Äù https://t.co/kCE3i935MZ@tails_dorian Yes, that is the fundamental problem. We have never said that the solution is a single operator. Governance reform is needed to establish a central authority to set standards, do network planning, and coordinate multiple operators.

More money on its own won‚Äôt solve our transit woes - we need governance reform to create a seamless, customer-focused system.@calisurf @SPUR_Urbanist It‚Äôs the tragedy of the commons and lack of leadership. Everyone acknowledges better regional governance is needed, yet without a compelling leader, we continue on the way we always have. We need strong, articulate champions of regionalism to overcome apathy and inertia.60 minutes to get between any two rail stations in the Bay Area?  Yes please! We‚Äôre excited about @SPUR_Urbanist‚Äôs vision for seamless megaregional rail. Check out our latest blog post: https://t.co/jpGSOVsjaH@hoverbird Transit Agencies do badly in UI and CX because they lack executive leadership in these areas. We recently wrote a blog post on this:  https://t.co/Q2qTzZyFBsNone of the Bay Area‚Äôs transit 27 agencies have a ‚ÄúChief Customer Officer‚Äù or departments dedicated to improving the customer experience of using transit.

It's free and open to all! https://t.co/2RLN1bwcWnWe hope our new map can accelerate a regional conversation about integrated fares in the Bay Area by making it easier to visualize how a comprehensive system of fares could work. \n\nRead all the details on our blog: https://t.co/PixVz2pr0Y https://t.co/b8tV4UpOVATransitioning to fully integrated fares would also require establishing a central regional authority with the ability to set fare policy, &amp; collect and distribute fare revenue to transit operators across the 9-county region.\n\nMore details about that here: https://t.co/P94GGBfgVVOur sketch-level financial analysis of the Integrated Fare Vision shows that regional fare revenue levels would remain similar to the pre-COVID status quo, but that the transit system would need add'l revenue to cover the additional discounts proposed for low income riders.Fare integration would be a highly beneficial long-term investment for the region. Earlier this year, MTC found that integrated fares were one of the most cost-effective projects we could invest in, attracting more people to transit &amp; reducing costs for low income people.Our Integrated Fare Vision resembles zone-based fare systems used in other regions‚Äîsuch as Zurich, Copenhagen, and greater Frankfurt‚Äî that have resulted in growing and widespread transit use in both urban and suburban areas. https://t.co/EK1bKinVeAOur Integrated Fare Vision would be a departure from the Bay Area‚Äôs current fragmented fare policies, in which riders pay additional fares &amp; are subject to different rules each time they transfer, which can make both local &amp; regional trips expensive and confusing ü§îDaily, weekly, and monthly fare caps would also give riders free additional trips once they take transit at least 2.5 times per day, 9 times a week, or 36 times per month ‚Äî eliminating the need for riders to decide before they travel whether to buy a high frequency pass. https://t.co/8NgwpPEfXdUnder our Integrated Fare Vision proposal, riders would be charged the same amount *no matter what mode of transit they use or how many times they transfer*, providing more predictability for riders while encouraging people to use the fastest route available. https://t.co/CynNkh04GPThe map divides the Bay Area into a series of 7-mile wide zones, each about the size of San Francisco. Fares are easy to calculate; riders simply count the minimum number of zones required to go between two points on the map, then look up the corresponding fare in the table. https://t.co/BYL0q8in8hToday, Seamless Bay Area is unveiling a map of our Integrated Transit Fare Vision ‚Äî a fully unified system of transit fares that would enable riders to travel seamlessly across the nine-county Bay Area with a single transit fare and free transfers üó∫Ô∏è https://t.co/P94GGBfgVV https://t.co/J1Yh89BzE4Read more on our blog: https://t.co/agBBiq41nf\n\nAnd thank you to our forum co-hosts @SFTRU, @ylinstitute, @alevin &amp; Friends of Caltrain, @SVYouthClimateA, @TransitRidersEB , and United Seniors of Oakland and Alameda County!Two riders currently living in one-car households reported that they were now considering buying a second car due to challenges riding transit in the Bay Area during the pandemic.One Sonoma County resident and transit rider reported that she had been forced to turn down a swing shift job because local buses are now only operating until 6:00 p.m., making it impossible for her to travel there and back.Riders reported ‚Äúlarge gaps‚Äù between buses on lines where service used to be more frequent, longer commutes, and challenges getting to work and to the airport.Takeaways from our Bay Area Transit Rider Forum on Oct. 15, focused on service changes and connectivity:\n\nAmong riders who have used transit regularly since March, many have experienced significant changes in their travel experience due to service cuts. https://t.co/agBBiq41nf‚òéÔ∏è On Oct. 28, we're joining @SPUR_Urbanist &amp; Asm. @DavidChiu for a special phone bank supporting #MeasureRR! \n\nWe'd love to see you there - tools &amp; training will be provided: https://t.co/ukfiBdkcVw\n\nCan't make it?

MTC is considering convening a process for transit funding (for 2024+), so that will be an opportunity to fund integration...@_Nataliea schedule integration is also needed but is separate and not covered in the fare integration study.

Standardizing regional fares or fully integrating fares would reduce driving 4x as much as Caltrain electrification, which is famed for being able to replace the need for 5 freeway lanes https://t.co/LTjmEJNy2NAnd the study shows that fare integration is a very cost-effective way to grow ridership - much more cost-effective than many other transit investments.... https://t.co/SOGXA9rOZlFree transfers would generate over 25,000 new trips, as much or more ridership as flagship bus likes such as the AC Transit 51 lines.

Lack of integrated routes, fares and schedules makes transit costly and inconvenient, forcing many to own cars and drive.Public transit is one of the best possible investments we can make in reducing inequality and poverty.  Imagine if poor Americans had 22.5% more income to spend on other things.Lack of quality public transit hurts poor people most, forcing many into expensive car ownership.\n\nUS: The poorest 20% spend 29% of income on transportation - mostly vehicle ownership costs because transit is so poor.\n\nEurope: The poorest 20% spend just 7.5% on transportation. https://t.co/wpgJqJ3UQw‚ÄúThe metro area lacks a shared aspiration and commitment to making its collective public transit network the best and most convenient option for a greater share of trips, nor does it have the mechanisms in place to deliver such a vision.‚Äù DC, we feel your pain.The movement for seamless transit is growing nationwide.

It‚Äôs a first step that can lead to greater integration and equity in our transit system. https://t.co/X3kpjlbDE3@SundayStreets Yesterday @VivaCalleSJ we asked dozens of people what would get them to ride transit more in the Bay Area.

VTA &amp; Caltrain provide some bus/rail services, but \"they are neither frequent enough nor time competitive enough to be an attractive option\"...so most residents commute by car. \n\nIt's an gap/opportunity worth pursuing. #regionaltransit\"In the South Bay, multiple commuter and passenger rail projects are in the works - but most of them target just a few travel corridors.

Voluntary collaboration is unlikely to be enough - we need to think of where we have leverage.((in the 1 minute provided for public comment, Seamless commented on the importance of creating a unified regional operator in improving project delivery))public comment happening now3 key questions:  (1) Should MTC set up a standard risk oversight process for megaprojects? (2) Should MTC implement a stage gate process?  (3) Should MTC condition funding on policy compliance?  If so what policies rise to the top? https://t.co/j35q1dBPF9Final discussion period:  What's MTC's role?  Pedroza:  Key question is how to implementing partners see MTC's role as additive, and not a hostile takeover?Now for the Megaproject Advancement Program. Kenneth Folan summarizes feedback from Commissioners - when costs change, cost-benefit should be reassessed. And there's a highlight on risk management strategies...Abe-Koga - perhaps not as oversight but as a resource to vet best practices, technologies. I shy away from the word oversight, I don't want to add more layers of bureaucracy.They could get paid for from the projects, defining cost, scope with a sense of objectivity ((I like the metaphor of a circuit rider rather than a mercenary))Liccardo, since we have FTA, additional oversight is not needed.  Refers to Josefowitz comments about experience and optimism bias.  MTC could staff a pool of project management professionals with experience with big projects.Chavez - adding extra layers adds complexity. Could instead we have more best practices to draw on from a regional level, for example with grade separations.  We should be a regional catalyst that creates opportunities for things we do in our communities....Commissioner Chavez - what is an example? McMillan's answer includes looking at the landscape and seeing what foundational capabilities might be missing ((such as integrated regional rail?))but even for the projects in the works, there is a role to play for oversight processes beyond what's provided by FTA - stage gate processes, independent peer reviews.and asks what role to play with regard to projects that are already in progress, in a way that does not add cost and delay...Vice Chair Josefowitz envisions a greater role for future projects starting with a connected network plan to ensure projects that build together in a good sequence...Spering calls on consultant to focus on what is best for the customer, not what existing constraints are.  We get too hung up on what works for operators - we must get beyond this.  Let's know what legislative changes are needed.Now Kate White of @ArupGroup facilitates a discussion among the Commission on what should MTC's role be?Back to Dawson who presents the timeline of the Rail Partnerships study.  Alternative assessment findings will feed into Network Management business case study.  ((Will a merged regional operator become one of the logical opportunities for a network manager?)) https://t.co/upJwKnM2RwCommon features - Layering of different organizations; Constant evolution over time.Success factors:  Developing necessary resources &amp; expertises; develop more systematic approach to innovation - Crossrail in particular led to a number of ongoing programs to share best practices more broadly within the sector.Once projects are complete from these special purpose entities, assets are transferred back to TfL or Network Rail.Gold also notes that London has also had a lot of evolution over time (like Toronto); layering in London:  TfL sets objectives for projects;  Network Rail operates many services and delivers many major projects;  HS2 and Crossrail are special purpose delivery vehicles. https://t.co/qHET72iTmfRaquel gold describes the 'layering' of various entities in greater Toronto - a provincial project delivery advisory entity, Infrastructure Ontario - a region-wide combined operator and project owner, Metrolinx (which includes GO Transit); and a local operator, TTC. https://t.co/jPGTtpwsyJRaquel Gold of consultant team takes over to introduce reference models for the bay area - greater Toronto, and greater London. https://t.co/57l9zxc2d8Lines of inquiry for this study:  Understanding suitability of existing structures in delivering on our many ambitions. https://t.co/PHHHPm627RAlaistair Dawson of @Steer_Group takes over; caveats that this study is in 'exploratory' mode, and will stop short of making recommendations. https://t.co/wNcthSSJRbNow for the long awaited study - McMillan describes that the $400k planning grant MTC received to explore potential different governance and delivery structures to achieve a more effective and seamless rail network.  Steer was selected as consultant.MTC has also more direct project delivery role as a builder - for Bay Bridge, Express Lanes, Electronic Tolling infrastructure.  Not so much on transit today though.McMillan:  MTC's current role in megaprojects is both as  a funder and an investor.  Investor refers to $$ that is fully within MTC's authority, i.e. RM 1, 2, or 3 funds.  This implies a bigger role for MTC's involvement.(public comment will be at the very end of the workshop, probably this afternoon sometime. But this is an important presentation to watch. We'll attempt to summarize key points here)Happening now: \nMTC's role in getting major projects delivered, with Executive Director Therese McMillan and the consultants from Steer giving the first preview of the long awaited Regional Rail Partnerships Governance &amp; Delivery study.\n\nhttps://t.co/LITAzCJ0SkLastly, in your public comment, feel free to use any of the talking points in the letter we submitted with @JointVentureSVN: https://t.co/1t8teFnXZq\nAsk @MTCBATA to do a detailed study on the costs &amp; benefits of a BART-Caltrain merger as a next step to the Regional Rail study.For more reasons why we think a unified rail operator - bringing together @SFBART and @Caltrain under one unified board - check out our blog post:  https://t.co/BpgAeCnXFfHere's the full agenda:\nhttps://t.co/7o1p85NCsm\n\nAnd here's the zoom link to make a comment.\nhttps://t.co/LITAzCJ0SkToday @MTCBATA is having a workshop on how to improve megaproject delivery. We must take immediate steps to create a unified Bay Area rail operator to create the expertise &amp; governance that can deliver our biggest projects. Speak up during Item #3 ~10:30-11:30am if you agree https://t.co/llGBumCbTZMotion to enable 2 hour free transfers and assess whether there is a Title VI problem (equity problem). If no problem, move ahead.  If there's a potential problem, bring it back to the board.Board member Peeples asks what % of people are using the mobile app vs. Clipper. Answer - about 1% are using the app...Board member Young is asking why free transfers is needed when there is a day pass with 3 trips per day. Director Shaw says that sometimes she takes the bus one way and takes BART in the other direction...Staff is saying that the mobile app already allows free transfers within 90 minutes because when you enable a ticket it's good for 90 minutes automatically - so they could change that to 2 hours without having to wait for Clipper...the Clipper project is saying that this feature won't be available until Clipper 2.0 in 2023 (which is reasonable), but that intra-agency transfers won't be available until even later than that (which is not reasonable)The AC Transit item on free bus to bus transfers is up now - this is the Zoom link to dial in and make public comment https://t.co/4Q0zh5MHz8 https://t.co/IkmsnKBgpGThe board changed the order of the meeting.

Mulligan closes the meeting - June 6th is next meeting!Tumlin:  \"Representativeness\" is an important concept - both of riders and of the population.  Muni has half the transit riders, SF is 75% of the origins/destinations in the region. How do we balance the need for geographic equity vs. set of needs for urban operators?McMillan:  This is a good summary of the essential elements. It's important to also recognize that these are stretch goals - where we should be headed - and it's OK that that's not where we are yet.Final part of the discussion:  Consultant team wants reactions on draft principles for entity design. https://t.co/YCR9vmDVoyFor example, blind passengers want to see standards for auditory queues across transit - on both regional and local service.Levin - Agrees with John-Baptiste that it's difficult to distinguish so distinctly between regional and local accountabilities when riders are reliant on all parts of the system to make a journey.Vice Chair John-Baptiste - What is our highest level goal with this?  Answer:  Transit must be the top choice for people, the easiest thing for people to choose.  This is necessary to then answer the question, \"what is regional vs. local\" - in reality it's hard to separate the 2.Currier - Key goal of RNM should to create the feeling of one unified system for riders.  RNM should take responsibility for equity regionally - serving concentrations of low income riders is not solely a local responsibility but a regional responsibility.Bouchard - Caltrain's challenge is that it's clearly a regional service but with impacts in a very local way - how is this handled? Notes the importance of highlighting what is the intersection between the parallel Regional Rail Partnership's study underway.Wunderman - disagrees with a slide in the packet that suggests that fares are a local responsibility - this seems out of step with MTC business case - asks for clarification. Especially with a new source of funding, fares can become a regional accountability - and should be.McMillan - key question is what is 'regionally significant' is very important - and can change over time based on circumstance. For example, a major local project might be considered local; but the moment it applies for regional money due to cost overruns, it becomes regional.Desmond (from consultant team) noted that another ad hoc committee emerging consensus was both \"do no harm\" -- but also don't use that as an excuse for not changing.Raad: Remarkable degree of alignment from ad hoc committee members on right division of accountabilites between RNM and local operators on infrastructure development, design, and delivery.  Key Q is what constitutes a 'major' project requiring regional accountability? https://t.co/7Lbd9OxLdkNow a discussion of accountabilities and authorities of a network manager....Familiar graphic, reprised from Blue Ribbon Transit Recovery Task Force - highighting which accountabilities (orange/red colors) require more direct authority from a centralized entity. https://t.co/HRmV7tJMOSRaad notes that accountabilities do not always match authorities - and this creates problems.  Creating a match is a key goal of governance reform.Authority = what powers does an entity hold to enable an accountable entity to carry out its assigned duties/obligations.Accountability = what entity is accountable for certain outcomes (i.e. integrated fares).Next Up: Discussion of what accountabilities and authorities of what a regional network manager (RNM) should be.Task force members compliment consultants on graphics and how these can be tools in helping us evaluate network management structures later on in the process.Raad: Fragmented landscape has been somewhat effective at meeting some local needs for funding, but not sufficient for regional needs.Another amazing slide summarizing complex funding sources, i.e. the root of the challenge. https://t.co/TJTTHIAnTRRaad:  Much transit agency ridership is local, but given how many regional trips are happening in cars, question is whether some amount of potential transit ridership is being 'left on the table'? https://t.co/1DZjzBgR3TTamim Raad of Access planning (consultant team) is sharing some amazing visualizations of the Bay Area's complex transit agency landscape https://t.co/KtryzTl537Network Management Business Case Advisory Committee happening now!

Time to reform our transpo institutions so they can deliver a seamless, world-class system.Over 10 hrs today we rode 8 transit systems, made 9 transfers, and spent $39.50.  While no sane person would do this whole loop, each segment of our trip connected jobs and housing centers, and reflects what some people do every day - and why many don‚Äôt use transit at all. https://t.co/4H54GWrAOFWhile this transit warrior trio cut the #transittourofthebay off after just half the Bay, due to terrible air quality, stay tuned for PART 2: The North Bay - More agencies, more fragmentation!

People are moving to the Central Valley, we should be focusing on travel to Tracy for affordable housing...Gonot - we want to work in coordination with MTC but transit agencies are so different, our funding sources are diverse. We could maybe accomplish it in 10 years.There are a lot of people from outside the county who work here and we want to make that easier.  We should say \"both and\" - we want it to work, and we want to set our conditions...We've got lots of reasons to gripe, and we're perceived as having a reputation for griping....Liccardo - I am afraid about the reputation we are getting for not being good regional collaborators...Lawson - our third fear is taking funding away from local operations. An example \"come up with a common format for real-time data\" - but the standard could change, and then we would need to change, and that would take money away from service....Mayor Liccardo.  I want to be clear about what are our fears - the loss of STA funding with noncompliance, the lack of representation on MTC. What else do we fear?...Lawson response to \"why are we looking only at one option.\" Sen Becker has recently introduced a bill SB917, with things we support - fares, wayfinding, tranfers. But it will be done by MTC, and if not agencies will be ineligible for STA funds ((this is a power MTC already has))Abe-Koga - the question is where the money would come from ((seamless transit polls at ~90% and is important to get future funding from voters))...We do want to serve our riders as seamlessly as possible... we've been hearing about input from riders, this  is important ((and how can riders give feedback when they use VTA and BART?))Abe-Koga - we're trying to do a one size fits all approach. Earlier on I had thought that consolidation might make sense, but it's not as easy as it might seem....The goal should be to respect the fact that there are 27 agencies with separate fiduciary responsibilities to taxpayers ((but what about when the taxpayers want service that is seamless across agencies?))What motivated this? Agencies working together to respond to Covid, being aware that there are 27 agencies with 27 boards and different sources of funding...We thought that the agencies putting service on the streets and should be the ones working together to get it done...Abe-Koga - what brought the GMs to bring this forward now, and what induced the GMs to come up with this \"preferred alternative\"Gonot - the first funding comes from federal relief money, and this is new money. We don't want to take money away from local trips to fund regional service ((this has not been proposed anywhere)).And Hendricks wants to know more about the roles and responsibilities sooner rather than later...Hendricks - what is the definition of success? How do we know it did a good thing. Is anyone looking at that? Haywood - it's early in the process. Different counties might have different goals....Hendricks - we are already aligning VTA service hours to connect to BART.  I'm looking for more clarity on what the practical change it would mean to us...It might affect signage and fares, where our board would no longer have the authority to set our own fares....Director Hendricks - can you explain what the change would be for VTA.  Haywood.  If the network manager required a transfer, we might have to run the service to make the transfer, instead of putting the service where we think it belongs...Chavez - I believe the goal is to do a better job of serving the public - in a self-help county...It feels to me like the direction MTC is going would be a greater barrier to us as a South Bay Region.Chavez - Santa Clara County is 25% of population but we've had a difficult time getting money to our county...Ramacier says that the operator option is similar to Clipper Executive Board with a broader range of operation....Gonot asks to for comparison with Clipper Executive Board.  Ramacier says this is similar, but CEB is focused on fare payment.Staff characterizes the alternative which would be a new body that could impose requirements on the transit agencies.Director Chavez - \"I have not felt that there are alternatives\" ((right they haven't been put forward yet))Staff - we will bring back the other alternatives also.  Peralez - we are moving in the right direction, but we should look at alternatives taking into account models around the countryCM Peralez asks for the board to see all of the options rather than to comment on one alternative, which staff had framed as a \"preferred alternative\"CM Peralez supports better transit coordination for riders even if this means agencies giving up some local control...VTA staff notes that most commute trips in Santa Clara County are intra-county, so transfers are less important in Santa Clara CountyThe model involves and advisory board where stakeholders advice a body composed of transit agency staff.    The model where stakeholders advice staff is the least powerful type of guidance.The proposal allows existing boards to retain their authorities, and changes will need to continue to go to 27 boards and MTC to make new policy refinementsVTA board is getting an update on the Bay Area's Transportation Network Management study.  But they are showing only one option, which is the option closest to the status quo....We have an infrastructure crisis in the Bay Area.

Fare integration would save riders $$; service integration would give riders back valuable time in life; and branding integration would save riders significant confusion/headache.(8/x) Capital planning cannot just be based on the preferences of local politicians and individual agencies. The previous leadership was too often an enabler of projects with dubious regional value.(7/x) With a new focus on customer experience bedded in, we think the MTC ED should then turn to restructuring capital planning in the region: this should be based on regional outcomes ‚Äî moving a certain number of people to destinations in a certain amount of time, for example(6/x) A rider should be able to move across the system without being punished financially, getting stuck at transfer points, and struggling to physically find their way. #seamlesstransit(5/x) We think this work should start with integrating fares, schedules and wayfinding. These are the most basic \"table stakes\" to qualify as having a world-class transit system.(4/x) Under prior leadership, implementation of regional vision ‚Äî such as it was ‚Äî lacked urgency, coherence and the kind of tough-minded attitude needed to corral so many agencies and regional leaders.(3/x) Once the vision is in place, we‚Äôd love to see Ms McMillan roll up her sleeves and get to the critical work of delivering change in accordance with that vision.(2/x) First, she should to propose and commit to a bold and inspiring vision for a seamlessly-integrated, customer-oriented, outcomes-driven transportation system, and to radical/direct honesty about the investments and governance reforms needed to get us there.(1/x) We have big hopes for Therese W McMillan, incoming Exec Director of @MTCBATA!\n\ntl;dr version: We want the MTC ED to step up as a true regional leader, and we look forward to partnering with her to advance the necessary governance and policy reforms that our region needs.Congrats to Therese W McMillan on being named the new Executive Director of @MTCBATA!

Regardless, a commitment to reform is needed. https://t.co/kKNC0iH4TrPart 2 explores the differences in funding sources &amp; total funding for transit across the Bay. We find that differences in sources among operators are less stark than they are sometimes presented; and that there are various definitions of 'local funds'.\nhttps://t.co/5BKn2OviboWe often hear that complex funding is a barrier to seamless transit.  \n\nIn our new 3-part blog series, we dive deep into this issue.

San Francisco should be front and center to making it happen.Director Ames asks about pilot - Staff clarifies that the study is recommending moving ahead with free transfers, not as a pilot, and that MTC has allocated up to 10% of American Rescue Plan funds for Blue Ribbon recs including fare integration...Ames asks about institutional requirements for standardizing regional fares. Staff - standardizing regional fares performs well on our metrics - in order to bring this about, we need governance and funding structures...Ames also supports expanding to ACE/CC/San Joaquin...Director Ames. This is a no-brainer.  I hope we implement tier 3 (standardizing regional fares) as soon as possible - BART, Caltrain, regional bus, ferry....Saltzman - this strongly supports our TOD goals.   With longterm changes in office commuting, fare integration will help support a greater diversity of trips and riders.  Saltzman wants the board to take a resolution when appropriate...Saltzman - we had an attempt to do BART-AC Transit tranfers and learned that this is something that 2 agencies can't do alone....Director Saltzman - it is exciting to see recommendations we can use, some very soon and some later. I am supportive of all the recommendations. Free/reduced transfers would be huge....Raburn suports first 2 measures as a first step toward the big prize which is full fare integration, options 3 and 4....Raburn elevates comments about Capitol Corridor, ACE, etc.  Staff - lessons could potentially be drawn for a broader geography ((international case studies suggest that transit coordination systems get started and then grow in geography and functional scope))...staff: they will further analyze passes with information from the pilot...Raburn asks about fare capping and is puzzled why it's not yet a recommendation ((we think the analysis done for the study is incomplete))...BART board discusses fare integration.

It kicks off an assessment of the governance structures of all transit agencies - and @MTCBATA - and will recommend structural reforms to improve our regional transportation decision-making. 7/xBetter decision-making &amp; oversight of transit agencies requires more relevant professional expertise on Boards - and in many cases, less political interference. This is a common feature of many world-class transit systems around the world with growing ridership. 6/xHowever, even on boards that have unelected officials, there is sometimes no requirement that appointees are thoroughly vetted for relevant professional experience - or a record of using public transit. 5/xBy our count, only 5 Transit Agencies have a more even mix of non-elected and elected members on their boards (@SamTrans, @GoCaltrain, @WCCTA, @GoldenGateBus, @TriDeltaTransit); and 2 agencies (@SFBayFerry and @sfmta_muni) have all-appointed, majority-unelected boards) 4/x.@smarttrain is not unique in its elected official-dominated board structure. Of the Bay Area's 27 transit agencies, 20 are run by all- or majority-elected official boards, of which 2 are directly elected, @SFBART &amp; @rideact (2 of only 3 elected transit boards in the country) 3/x\"In times of fiscal challenges, far better oversight is provided by a board including members with [relevant] professional experience.\n\nIt remains helpful to have some political &amp; geographically centered directors, but a board 100% composed of local politicos is excessive.\" 2/xTransit Agency Boards made up entirely of elected officials are not in the best interest of riders.

Not too many surprises in their advice: invest in mobility hubs (&amp; the areas around them!), focus on end-to-end user experience, and bring the modes together better! #regionalmobilityToday is #TransitEquityDay, chosen in honor of Rosa Parks on her birthday. We believe fare &amp; service integration across the Bay Area is paramount for an equitable system. Why? Because access to frequent, connected, affordable transit is access to opportunity. https://t.co/3xZS0tU1xD@alevin @anniefryman @Scott_Wiener @gillibits @KG_DC https://t.co/43v9okaDWZ‚ò∫Ô∏èall the transit love ü•∞ https://t.co/VVZZuPjmw1@ratnaamin re:Seamless Transit report: \"My #1 finding was that the customer experience was not understood, accounted for, and addressed in any kind of serious manner. I see that starting to change thanks to advocates. And innovators within agencies.\"\n\nYes! We'll keep at it! ‚ú®Congrats @ratnaamin on your new adventure! Your advocacy and thoughtful research - especially for @SPUR_Urbanist's 'Seamless Transit‚Äô report - will continue to be influential in guiding Bay Area transportation in the right direction!\n\np.s. thanks for the shout-out üôÇ https://t.co/BJMSIraGwy to numeric"
